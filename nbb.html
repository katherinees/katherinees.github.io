	<h1>Never Be Bored</h1>
  <p style="color:gray; font-size:16px">A recommndation blog documenting my journey through my never-ending queue of books, movies, albums, webcomics, etc, etc, etc. For each thing I like, I'm recommending things to go with it based on similar themes&mdash;not just books for book posts or movies for movie posts, but music and comics too, things you might not see otherwise. </p><hr>
  <h2>On Computability</h2>
  <p><i>The Annotated Turning: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine</i> by Charles Petzold. <i>The Code Book</i> by Simon Singh, Project Euler,&nbsp;<i>Love and Math</i> by Edward Frenkel.&nbsp;</p><p>Fair warning: <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Turing-Through-Historic-Computability/dp/0470229055/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541048776&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+annotated+turing">The Annotated Turing</a></i>&nbsp;by Charles Petzold is heavy on the math. If that's not your thing, you might want to give this a pass. If, however, you are like me a great nerd, I can't recommend this enough. Alan Turning was a gay English mathematician who is now well known as the father of theoretical computer science and for his part in cracking Enigma. Petzold takes us through one of Turing's most famous papers, line by line, paragraph by paragraph.</p><p>Axioms are statements that are taken to be true without proof, because they are so fundamental (e.g. <i>x = x</i> for any <i>x</i>). Mathematicians attempt use axioms to prove statements, theorems, using logic, but, as G&ouml;del proved, there exist statements which are <i>impossible</i> to prove given a set of axioms. But what is the method for deciding whether or not a given statement can be proven? Turing's 1936 paper and the subject of this book proved that this question has <i>no</i> answer. Turing showed that there is no general process for deciding whether or not a given statement is provable. In short: some statements cannot be proven, and there is no general process for deciding which statements are unprovable.&nbsp;</p><p>Still with me? That's the complicated problem Turing solves, and he does it in a novel way, by describing theoretical computing machines&mdash;now known as universal Turing machines. Yup, the first hypothetical computers were used as tools by Turing to solve a mathematics problem. And for more details, you'll just have to read the paper.</p><p>My first introduction to Turing was by learning about how he helped crack Enigma, the code machines used by Nazi Germany to encrypt military messages (a neat Numberphile video on that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ">here</a>). For more on that&mdash;and a lot more besides, try <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323">The Code Book</a></i> by Simon Singh, which is a bit lighter on the math than <i>The Annotated Turing</i> while still going into technical details. Singh presents a history of codemakers and codebreakers throughout history&mdash;the constant and ongoing war between those who try and keep secrets and those that would try to steal them.</p><p>Love the idea of the intersection of math and computer science? Then you must check out <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>, a website of puzzles. Each problem requires a combination of mathematical <i>and</i> coding background to be able to solve. For example: triangle numbers are the sums of natural numbers, like 10, which is 1+2+3+4, and which has 4 divisors, namely, 1, 2, 4, and 10. What, then, is the first triangle number with over 500 divisors?</p><p>If you liked the heavy math of <i>The Annotated Turing</i>, but wanted a bit more of a <i>story</i>, then check out<i> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Math-Heart-Hidden-Reality/dp/0465050743">Love and Math</a></i> by Edward Frenkel. Part passionate ode to the beauty and elegance of mathematics, part autobiography, this book made me want to be a theoretical mathematician. From his account of his early education in Russia to Fermat's last theorem to the Langlands Program, Frenkel has such a genuine <i>love</i> for math that shows.</p><hr>
  <h2>Floor It</h2>
  <p><i>Baby Driver</i>, 2017 Edgar Wright film. <i>Ocean's 8</i>, 2018 Gary Ross film, travel posters by Alex Asfour, short animated films <i>Electrocop</i> by Corentin Yvergniaux and <i>Voltige</i> by L&eacute;o Brunel.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XMuUVw7TOM">first scene</a> of <i>Baby Driver</i> has to be one of the best first scenes of all time. Within the first few minutes we get to see Baby, a music loving getaway driver, do his thing&mdash;i.e., drive a pretty car super fast and perfectly in time to the song he's playing on his iPod. While a bank robbery goes on in the background, Baby is rocking out in the car, and once they need to make their escape, he leads the police on a merry chase around downtown Atlanta, all to the beat of Bellbottoms by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.</p><p>At its heart, <i>Baby Driver</i> is a classic action movie with a hint of romance, and while it does at times flirt with the cliche, it has so much <i>fun</i> with it that it's still one of my favorite movies. Every scene, every moment, every shot seems like it was carefully crafted for effect, and put together, it's amazing to watch. No wonder it was nominated for and won various awards for editing and sound mixing&mdash;it's a masterpiece, full stop.</p><p>For another flashy action movie, try Gary Ross's 2018 <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5164214/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Ocean's 8</a></i>. I adore heist movies like this, I like seeing all the planning and then watch each little piece fall into place. Points for an all-women heist team featuring Sandra Bullock, Rihanna, and Awkwafina, double points for the scene where they all show up at the Met Gala looking <i>flawless</i>.</p><p>If you too dream of driving off into the sunset with vintage flair, check out the work of Alex Asfour, and his travel posters in particular. His freelance work is at <a href="http://www.ideastormstudios.com">IdeaStorm Creative Studio</a>, but I think it's easier to check out all the amazing travel posters through his online <a href="http://ideastorm.bigcartel.com">store</a>. The collection has a cohesive feel, but each poster is unique, and the colors and gradients are just absolutely gorgeous!&nbsp;</p><p>I studied abroad in Arles, France a few summers ago, and one of the highlights was watching the end-of-year projects from the nearby animation school Ecole MoPA in a Roman amphitheater. These students are seriously talented (one recent graduation project was nominated for an Oscar) and a lot of their work is posted online. If you loved the music synched car scenes of <i>Baby Driver</i>, watch <i><a href="https://vimeo.com/167422015">Electrocop</a></i> by Corentin Yvergniaux. (I think the theme of the year was carsâ€”another of my favorites was <i><a href="https://vimeo.com/167532594">Voltige</a></i> by L&eacute;o Brunel.)</p><hr>
  <h2>Really Big Worms</h2>
  <p><i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert, science fiction novel. <i>Ender's Game</i> by Orson Scott Card, <i>Too Like the Lightning</i> by Ada Palmer, and <i>Drive</i> by Dave Kellett.&nbsp;</p><p>Intrigue! Revolution! Ecology and religion and <i>really</i> big worms! <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538859852&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=dune&amp;dpID=41dYX%252BWUkaL&amp;preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch">Dune</a></i> has it all. This is one of <i>the</i> classic science fiction novels&mdash;an excellent choice both for those who don't read a lot of sci fi and want to start with a Hugo and Nebula winner (I will pretty much read anything with a Hugo nomination, and I haven't been let down yet) as well as for those who are already sci fi lovers.</p><p><i>Dune</i> drops you straight into the middle of the story, and it's up to you to figure out this strange future world as it goes along. Case in point: the book begins as the Duke of House Atreides, his concubine the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, their son Paul, and their advisors and servants are headed to Arrakis, a harsh desert planet which is the only source of the invaluable spice <i>melange</i>. Right away the reader is left with a thousand questions and no choice but to keep reading in hopes of getting some answers&mdash;the kind of world building which is absolutely my <i>jam </i>(although you might want to give it a couple of chapters to really get going). This is a novel with some major scope, and just from a literary standpoint, a worthwhile read. <i>Dune</i> was published in 1965, and since then has become the best selling science fiction novel of all time and has had a huge cultural impact (there's even a crater on the moon named for the book).</p><p>Frank Herbert also wrote five sequels to <i>Dune</i>, there's a 1984 film, a miniseries, and even more books written by others inspired by <i>Dune</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you loved the whole Chosen One vibe of Paul, but wanted something set in a slightly more familiar setting, try <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enders-Ender-Quintet-Orson-Scott/dp/0812550706/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538859887&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=ender%27s+game&amp;dpID=51L10EnuJbL&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch">Ender's Game</a></i> by Orson Scott Card. It's got that young protagonist trying to deal with his duties/destiny, but most of it is set on, or in orbit around, Earth. It also won the Hugo and Nebula awards and also has many sequels.&nbsp;</p><p>If you loved the intense figure-it-out-as-you-go-along world building, but wanted something a little more modern, try <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Too-Like-Lightning-Terra-Ignota/dp/0765378019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538859925&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=too+like+the+lightning+ada+palmer">Too Like the Lightning</a></i> by Ada Palmer, the first in her Terra Ignota series. If Dune is the Baby Boomer's or Gen X's science fiction, <i>Too Like the Lightning</i> belongs to the millennials and Gen Z. An excellent mix of political intrigue, discussions of gender dynamics, philosophy, and murder.</p><p>If you loved the idea of the secretive transportation Guild and a government spanning solar systems, but were looking for something funny and a bit less intense, try <i><a href="http://www.drivecomic.com">Drive</a></i>, an ongoing webcomic by Dave Kellett. I like the art style all in blue and white, the characters are lovable, and Dave Kellett is a master of comedic timing in comic panels.</p>
