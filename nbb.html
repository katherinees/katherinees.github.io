  <h2>Strange and Yet Familiar</h2>
	<p><i>Elsewhere University</i> by Sam - Charmingly Antiquated. <i>North of Reality</i> by Uel Aramchek; Jenna Barton - Dappermouth art; <i>The How How Much Much and I</i> by Cosmo Sheldrake.</p>

	<hr>

	<p>There might be an eldritch horror in the lake, so try out for the sailing team at your own risk. There are steam tunnels under the observatory covered in the graffiti of lost civilizations. It's okay to accept the offer of a study guide from the person who sits next to you in Intro to Econometrics, but under no circumstances meet them for a cram session at the library past midnight.</p>

	<p><i>Elsewhere University</i> is a comic series (part <a href="https://tapas.io/episode/598920">one</a>, part <a href="https://tapas.io/episode/805647">two</a>) by Sam, also known as <a href="https://charminglyantiquated.tumblr.com">Charmingly Antiquated</a>. Her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/charm_illustrations/">art</a> style&mdash;almost angular and sharp in places with amazing textural patterns&mdash;lends itself so well to the story of this school where you'd better have a safename and be wary of gifts from strangers. It's inspired a <a href="https://elsewhereuniversity.tumblr.com">blog</a> with an entire community's worth of short story submissions, more art of the students and residents of EU, and requests for fortunes.</p>

	<p>It's weird and it's wonderful, it's strange and yet familiar. It's the superstitions of your college gone sidewise&mdash;not quite "if you step on the university seal you'll fail your next midterm" but "if you walk though this fairy ring you'll fail your next midterm <i>and</i> owe a debt to the Seelie Queen."</p>

	<hr>

	<p>Charmingly Antiquated has published other comics about seafaring and wishes and many other things, in her <i><a href="https://tapas.io/series/cornerwitches">Cornerwitches</a></i> series.</p>

	<p><i><a href="http://www.northofreality.com">North of Reality</a></i> is a micro-fiction series by Uel Aramchek detailing strange and beautiful worlds. If you loved how the ordinary and magical interact at Elsewhere University, you might like reading about what happens when you take a wrong turn at <a href="http://www.northofreality.com/tales/2015/8/19/a-wrong-turn-at-albuquerque">Albuquerque</a> or go on a date with an <a href="http://www.northofreality.com/tales/2016/4/7/old-habits-die-hard">antichimera</a>. I particularly like the Deep Kitchen posts&mdash;menus featuring jellied piano <a href="http://www.northofreality.com/tales/2016/1/15/a-trendy-restaurant">keys</a> with raspberry jam and $9.99 <a href="http://www.northofreality.com/tales/2016/2/22/a-cheap-diner-in-west-texas">hummingbird</a> skewers with peach slices and local petroleum glaze. North of Reality isn't being updated anymore, but Uel is still tweeting microfiction <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePatanoiac?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@ThePatanoiac</a>.</p>

	<p>I absolutely adore <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dappermouth/">Jenna Barton</a>'s art. Her work has a lovely, almost surrealist quality, animals and liminal spaces like something from a dream, and each piece is accompanied by a sentence of gorgeous prose. My favorite is <i><a href="http://dappermouth.storenvy.com/products/23827419-concrete-dark-print">Concrete Dark</a></i>&mdash;I loved it from the second I saw it, I felt like I <i>recognized</i> it the first time I saw it, I swear I think I've had a nightmare about wandering concrete halls that looked just like those.</p>

	<p>If I, walking near the edge of the forest at Elsewhere University, heard the song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIyl9bCp6W4">Come Along</a>" by Cosmo Sheldrake coming from deep among the trees, the Fair Folk would have no trouble kidnapping me because I would absolutely follow that music straight to the Summer Court. Cosmo Sheldrake's album <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0j3JXvhwr5TPF4rt3qfzxL?si=hCDuWcIiRUOEhm8mjPW8Uw">The How How Much Much and I</a></i> is like nothing else I've ever heard&mdash;beautiful and delicate and feral and covered in moss.</p>

<p style="color:gray; font-size:16px">Never Be Bored is a recommendation blog documenting my journey through my never-ending queue. For each thing I like, I'm recommending things to go with it based on similar themes&mdash;not just books for book posts or movies for movie posts, but music and comics too, things you might not see otherwise.
