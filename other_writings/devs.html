  <h2>Ghost in the Machine: Comparing Tropes in Three Pieces of Media Katherine & Kienan Have Watched</h2>
	<p></p>

	<hr>

  <p>In Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Dr M'Benga puts his daughter, Rukiya, fatally ill with about twelve weeks to live, into the medical transporter in stasis. In Foundation, Hari Seldon uploads his digital self to a computer on the Raven upon his death, and speaks to Gaal when she arrives to the ship. In Devs, Forest's Devs team works on a quantum computer that allows them to view the past; Forest frequently watches his now deceased daughter Amaya blow bubbles via the machine.
  <p>So the ghosts are Rukiya, Hari, and Amaya. The machines are a medical transporter, a ship computer, and a quantum computer. The hauntees (?) are M'Benga, Hari himself, and Forest.</p>

<p>A. Are the Ghosts dead?</p>

<p>Hari and Amaya are both definitely physically dead. Rukiya is technically still alive, but in stasis. I think you could argue that narratively, a child that cannot grow up in any meaningful way is not really alive, either. On the other hand, Hari's case is presented as more of "immortality via technology" case. If the digitized version of himself still has all his memories and motivations, is he not still alive? Amaya is also definitely dead in Forest's world, but in the multiverse, there are many worlds where she still lives.</p>

<p>B. Are the Ghosts even in the Machine?</p>

<p>Rukiya is usually in the machine. Hari is dependent on the machine, but he gets to walk around too. Amaya isn't in the machine per se but is only visible via the machine.</p>

<p>C. Are the Ghosts trapped?</p>

<p>By definition I think ghosts should be trapped. The whole point is that they aren't alive anymore, but they also can't "move on." Rukiya is mostly trapped; if she leaves the machine she dies, unless M'Benga can find a way to cure her disease. Hari is somewhat trapped&mdash;his digitized self travels to Terminus. Amaya is extremely trapped, dead in the past. And if Forest is right and the universe is totally deterministic, then Amaya is not only trapped but also was always going to be trapped, i.e., doomed. Okay trapped doesn't even look like a real word anymore.</p>

<p>D. Why can't they move on?</p>

<p>So M'Benga put Rukiya into the machine, Forest keeps Amaya's memory alive in the machine. It's not that the daughters can't or won't move on, it's the fathers. Which is also probably unhealthy for both of them. Hari did it to himself, uploaded himself. He's got plans and he means to see them through, and a little thing like death isn't going to stop him. So there's this element of control- by putting Rukiya into the transporter M'Benga regains control over a situation (daughter dying of disease) that is/was out of his control (because he can't cure her) because now he can control how she experiences time. Hari gains control over death by in some sense escaping it. Forest is trying to control a totally uncontrollable system, quantum mechanics, by being able to observe it. Also there's this element of hubris&mdash;to control the uncontrollable. And it's not just the Ghosts who can't move on, it's the Hauntees too&mdash;M'Benga can't let his daughter go, Hari can't trust anyone else to finish his plans, Forest can't move on from his daughter's death.</p>

<p>E. How do the Ghosts experience time?</p>

<p>Rukiya experiences time in bursts. Mostly she's in stasis, and when M'Benga brings her out she experiences time normally, as part of the living world. Hari initially has an issue with his digitization and loops his death over and over again. But once that's sorted, presumably he also experiences time somewhat normally? But also, as a digital representation, he maybe has infinite time. Probably he can hibernate? Probably he can't die again unless his program is destroyed? Amaya experienced time normally. Although she sort of loops too, since Forest mostly watches that same scene of her blowing bubbles over and over. The person who really has an interesting experience with time is Forest, who's obsessed with his past. An also maybe future but that's a separate point. And all three Ghosts become Ghosts because they don't have enough time- Rukiya because she's dying, Hari and Amaya because they're already dead.</p>

<p>F. Do the Ghosts have agency in the world?</p>

<p>Rukiya mostly no, she's terminally ill and hidden on the Enterprise. But she can interact with M'Benga normally when she's out of stasis. Hari yes, that was the whole point of his becoming a Ghost in the first place. Amaya not at all, her machine is a one way mirror into the past, and anything she does is something that has already happened in the past and cannot be changed.</p>

<p>G. Where did the Machine come from?</p>

<p>The medical transporter is a pretty standard piece of Star Trek tech. The Machine isn't the interesting part, here, and can be used for other things. Probably Hari designed or at least implemented his digitization? His Machine is more interesting than the transporter, but it's mostly treated as an extension of Hari himself. Forest's team builds the quantum computer, and so the focus is just as much on the Machine as it is on the Ghost. Also, there are many Ghosts in that Machine, but narratively Amaya is the most important.

<p>H. How close is the Ghost to the living person?</p>

<p>Rukiya is of course still alive. Hari I think is ambiguous. His digital self is supposed to have all the memories and personality he had when he was alive, but is it really him? Does a program have the ability to grow and change like a human can? Is it really Hari or just an echo? When Lyndon and later Katie implements the many worlds algorithms&mdash;is the Amaya Forest sees on screen his Amaya? Or another one from another universe?</p>
<br><br>
<hr>
<p>okay that was my actually thought out thoughts, here's the uh stream of consciousness notes section<p>
  EP 1
<br><br>
did we ever figure out what was Up with those obelisks that appeared? was that an art project?
<br><br>
oooo elliptic curves. I gotta find that textbook on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems.
<br><br>
mm georgean chanting (?) when they walk into devs like religion => like they're playing gods
<br><br>
what's with the watch???
<br><br>
so my first guess would have been that they proved multiverse theory, except forest said he wasn't a fan of that theory. or maybe he's just not a fan of other worlds?
<br><br>
second thought is they created actual artificial intelligence. and the giant girl is the like physical avatar of that. so his work with the nematodes was him showing he could handle it
<br><br>
oh my god did they prove that there's no free will? maybe they're computing the future. hence katie's comment that "it doesn't change anything"
<br><br>
oh the watch stole the code. or recorded it.
<br><br>
"YOU COULD HAVE ONLY DONE WHAT YOU DID" IM SCREAMING
<br><br>
oh no are they gonna kill my boy sergei. oh sergi :(
<br><br>
wait so. if they're computing the future. is he basically saying that they always knew they were going to kill him?? so they just gave him the promotion and did all that stuff knowing??
<br><br>
oh lily babe :(
<br><br>
wiping and resetting a phone- she wanted to know what was on it from the last backup?? man she went into detective mode like Right Away
<br><br>
hm did forest's kid die? is that who that giant girl is?
<br><br>
jeez is katie really like "yeah isn't it so sad that we murdered that guy like poor us we didn't even have a choice :("
<br><br>
oh jamie :(
<br><br>
oh ho ho she did the praying hands. a la "most logical person will start praying when their child is in danger".
<br><br>
oh wow does lily suck? maybe she kind of sucks!
<br><br>
okay but that's a really smart way of covering up a body, just fake video of him setting himself on fire and then burn the body. no muss no fuss no autopsy.
<br><br>
I feel like lily's killer mental math skills are going to make an appearance again.
<br><br>
lmao I am not surprised one bit to see that the director and writer for this is the ex machina guy
<br><br>
EP 2
<br><br>
okay so what's the significance of where they burn sergei's body? at the feet of giant girl? like a sacrifice?
<br><br>
oh okay so forest's daughter definitely died. oh the whole company is named after her.
<br><br>
huh okay so that's why he doesn't like the multiverse theory. because he says when she died he felt like he was split into two states.
<br><br>
huh he's being so nice to her!
<br><br>
hm so forest has dogs, fish. left her room as is because of course he did.
<br><br>
ah yes we love an emotionally unhelpful immigrant mother.
<br><br>
yo that's a nice apartment for san francisco right
<br><br>
literally why does she think jamie can do anything about that. like obviously brute force is no good. she's the best person to try and guess it.
<br><br>
what the flying fuck is that a person on the machine screen?? HOLY FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE JESUS ON THE CROSS WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY LOOKING INTO THE PAST
<br><br>
I mean if you can extrapolate forwards why not extrapolate back
<br><br>
why does sergei message his theoretically russian handler in english lmao
<br><br>
"don't feel invaded no one has a private life anymore" lmao
<br><br>
omg he wants to see his daughter again I bet
<br><br>
oh called it! oh is that the weird hand position on the statue? she's blowing bubbles? hm, is that those glowing rings around the trees? the bubbles?
<br><br>
the mortifying ideal of being knowwwnnnnnn jamie knowing that lily would absolutely use the app
<br><br>
EP 3
<br><br>
we have two rules: only look back never forwards, and we don't invade privacy. so like guarantee they're gonna break those rules lol. has katie already looked forward? to know what sergei did?
<br><br>
so is it gonna rain tomorrow? doesn't look like it oooooo I love u doublespeak
<br><br>
lily maybe has schizophrenia ?? is jen for real??
<br><br>
WHAT WHAT BROOKLYN WHAT
<br><br>
omg JEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH KEN'S COMPUTER
<br><br>
OH MY GOD JEN IS IN ON IT.
<br><br>
also how tf did they come up with a plan that fast?
<br><br>
EP 4
<br><br>
who is forest watching on the screen? is that sergei in death or lily in the future?
<br><br>
HMM lily stayed the niiiight
<br><br>
huh okay def future
<br><br>
"I'M SCARED WE MAY BE MAGICIANS"?????
<br><br>
also, at this point lily and jamie have no idea what devs even does right?
<br><br>
what's up with the homeless guy and why isn't he scared of kenton? also has anyone even told him that sergei is dead?
<br><br>
"are you close with your mother?" "more or less" "what does that mean?" "I don't know. we act close" I'M FUCKING SCREAMING LILY
<br><br>
okay so is jamie gonna try and win her back and that's why he's fixing up his place?
<br><br>
okay so if lyndon swaps it for many worlds, how can he possibly know if he has the right world? we want to know what X said in this world. oh okay forest is on the same page. also, side note, I loved that actor in bad times at the el royale so love to see them here. also I love him and stewart's friendship
<br><br>
oh jesus fuck FUCK INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATIONS
<br><br>
oh fucking power move, katie was really like "are you gonna fire me too asshole"
<br><br>
also. why is the "deeply damaged older man grieving the loss of a loved one" always obsessed with a wife or daughter. like it's never a son. or a husband. or a brother or best friend. I suppose counterpoint is silent sea, with song ji-an. she was obsessed with her dead sister.
<br><br>
KENTON IF YOU HURT JAMIE !!!!!! oh fuck oh fuck
<br><br>
EP 5
<br><br>
oh i'm loving this multiverse apartment scene
<br><br>
symbolism of the go scene ? => lily acts intuitively ?
<br><br>
hm okay so she didn't meet sergei until after she broke up with jamie
<br><br>
"I'm in love with you" "Whoa." LMAO. "cool" LMAO
<br><br>
lecture on quantum mechanics&mdash; okay so if they're observing the past, does that mean changing the past?
<br><br>
WAIT OKAY SO DOES THAT MEAN MAYBE FOREST WANTS TO BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE PAST SO THAT HE CAN CHANGE IT SO THAT HE CAN GET HIS DAUGHTER BACK
<br><br>
what are these objects? rat, sugar cube, clock, shell. oh shit is this like the infinite perspective machine from hitchhiker's guide?
<br><br>
GHOST IN THE MACHINE GHOST IN THE MACHINE
<br><br>
oh my GOD he had to watch her die just like that. and presumably he thinks it was his fault, because maybe he distracted her while driving. ah yup katie's on the same page.
<br><br>
JAMIE TO THE RESCUE!!!! lol they're always climbing through windows. wait but katie knows??
<br><br>
EP 6
<br><br>
also it's sort of interesting that all forest's grief seems focused on amaya, and not his wife
<br><br>
OH that shot of forest with flowers in his beard. im getting like ophelia vibes from that one painting. drowning, death, madness, grief.
<br><br>
stewart & lyndon bffs &#x3c;3
<br><br>
lyndon ur my fav pls don't die I beg
<br><br>
how long has it been since amaya died? all her pictures are still up on the fridge
<br><br>
are katie and forest sleeping together? or did katie just know lily was coming and that's why she's there? does lily have any idea who katie is?
<br><br>
wow katie really does not give a fuck about the things she's done.
<br><br>
okay but if katie knows lily is going to die in however many hours from now, what is still doing? why did she sent forest out? is katie trying to protect him? because he "didn't want these things to happen/intend for them to happen"?
<br><br>
"you look like defense" wtf does that mean forest
<br><br>
sergei realized what devs was and threw up, lily is just like "okay" lol.
<br><br>
forest: "better to have loved and lost" does he actually believe that? it feels like a very cliched thing to say. does everyone really know forest's loss? does jamie really know?
<br><br>
AND THEY THINK IT INVOLVES LILY??? is katie bullshitting here because she knows lily is going to die? is this her plan to get lily to die like she thinks is "supposed" to happen? god I hate Chosen One bullshit plot lines
<br><br>
lmao forest and jamie playing frisbee in the street? how is forest not fucking traumatized by that car accident?
<br><br>
"what if you're wrong?" "wrong?" as if katie has never heard of the word "wrong" before
<br><br>
omg kenton go away
<br><br>
okay I don't think that this singularity point katie talked about is real. I think forest would be freaking out more about it if it were true. I suppose from lily's point of view it's the same. her future is unknowable past a certain point, because she's going to die.
<br><br>
"stay in my bed" im dead. I feel like this is a bad idea. just bc you didn't really know who sergei was doesn't mean that you didn't have feelings for him. you can't just swap him out for your ex. this feels unfair to jamie
<br><br>
katie and forest pillow talking&mdash;do they see themselves in lily/jamie?
<br><br>
okay fine I guess that point is a really thing. hm. maybe lily's going to destroy the machine. like presumably the world isn't going to end.
<br><br>
EP 7
<br><br>
okay first here are some questions I have going into this
<br><br>
we still don't know why sergei tried to steal the code, or really just what his deal was. the russian dude died and there was no follow up there.
<br><br>
are we gonna get more of an explanation for the giant amaya statue? is there something in there?
<br><br>
how did katie and forest get together? why do the quantum predictions break down after a certain point?
<br><br>
okay here we go
<br><br>
this sounds like inuit throat singing? was that a vision of the past?
<br><br>
"so..." "don't." lmao. I maintain this is a Bad Idea
<br><br>
how does katie feel about hanging out in her boyfriend's house with all his odes to amaya still up? oh yikes is that the multiverse kid she might have had? or is that kid also supposed to be amaya? okay maybe also amaya. which is interesting because if amaya lived/lianne would have lived, katie would never have gotten together with forest
<br><br>
idk like I just don't know how much I trust katie/forest's relationship. is katie really into forest, or does she just see just know that they're "supposed to be together"? does forest love katie for katie or is she just the blonde woman who is helping him prove his innocence? the pillow talking thing from last episode was sweet, but like where is the chemistry with them?
<br><br>
OH MY GOD WAIT ONE FUCKING SECOND STEWART. IF THEY'VE CREATED A SIM OF THE UNIVERSE?? you know it's like that thought experiment right&mdash;it goes like this: if we can create a perfect simulation of the universe, then in that simulated universe, those people could create a perfect simulation of the universe. and then those people could create a perfect simulation of the universe. and so on. so then how likely is it that we are the top-most level? that we are not simulated? well. not very likely at all. so if we create a simulation of the universe, it immediately becomes likely that we are ourselves in a simulation. AHHHH. (although I suppose there is a slightly different emphasis here, the computer isn't simulating a universe, it is specifically looking backwards/forwards at ours. even so)
<br><br>
WHAT THE FUCK STEWART. also what do they feel in that moment? are they compelled to act as they see themselves acting? UH OH INDEED STEWART
<br><br>
"remember Lyndon's in your car. there's that whole thing" GOD THE IMPLICATIONS. but also NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HURT LYNDON PLS
<br><br>
"they're having the tech nerd's wettest dream" lmao
<br><br>
I feel like the smartest option here would be for lily to like make it impossible for her to go to devs today. like hop a plane to india. can't go to the creepy vacuum vault if you're on one of the longest flights in the world. so long as she is in sf she could conceivably be kidnapped and brought to devs.
<br><br>
then again we did just get that whole moment where stewart and the other devs really did do exactly as they were predicted to, one second away. so at this point are we meant to believe that the computer is/always will be correct? that lily must go to devs?
<br><br>
also. interesting choice of location for the lyndon/katie talk. mm a dam. symbolic of man's ultimately futile attempts to control nature. all dams must some day fall. why did lyndon want to go there? im worried someone's gonna try and push the other off the dam and into the water
<br><br>
"do you want me to pretend I don't know what happens next?" oof. "while I have the illusion of free will I have the illusion of free will".
<br><br>
YES lyndon it's beautiful because it's elegant and it's beautiful because it's true and it's true because it's beautiful but ALSO pls bb don't fall
<br><br>
oh my god he's totally gonna die isn't he. god katie ur so fucking cold. NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<br><br>
"I don't mind that you don't know who I was quoting but I do mind that you can't even guess". YES like you know you don't have to be right all the time, you don't have to know the past and the future and everything in between. it's actually OKAY FOR SOME THINGS TO BE UNKNOWABLE
<br><br>
also. who was the interior designer for this place. all the golden curving inlays. it's beautiful.
<br><br>
one sec I gotta google mark antony. hm okay worked for julius caesar. was part of the triumvirate with lepidus and octavian. married octavia and had kids with cleopatra. civil war. committed suicide with cleopatra. not immediately seeing why stewart is calling out him in particular but maybe it will come up later
<br><br>
god it must be so fucking weird for jamie to be back in the apartment he shared with lily, but with sergei in between
<br><br>
this song choice "sweet little mystery"!!
<br><br>
sneaky keaton get tf out of here
<br><br>
JAMIE!!!!!!!
<br><br>
deus ex pete????????? pete is russian???????????
<br><br>
my orders?? from WHOM? and WHY?
<br><br>
katie:"he's quoting shakespeare or something" was it shakespeare though?? there's no way. okay yeah no the scansion was all wrong. it's aubade by philip larkin. so (1) yeah katie doesn't care about the past in the sense that stewart does/wants them to. and (2) idk anything about philip larkin but 'aubade' is a name for a poem or music that is about/played at dawn. so. lots to unpack there.
<br><br>
at the end of the world, katie and forest watch dinosaur movies and his home videos.
<br><br>
lily walking through devs, security sees her, presumably with the ability to kick her right out, but she's cleared to go. from her perspective, nothing just happened, but actually she's been approved/allowed to continue on her path
<br><br>
love the way those glowing circles around the trees cast light only down, so that it looks like the trees just cut off above. something something nature/the universe extending into the future, unknowable after that point
<br><br>
stewart just hanging out at the devs entrance like a cryptic guardsman. "oh you can't turn around? okay then, i'll open the doors to this super closed access facility for you, no prob"
<br><br>
