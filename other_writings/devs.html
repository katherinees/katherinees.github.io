  <h2>Ghost in the Machine: Comparing Tropes in Three Pieces of Media Katherine & Kienan Have Watched</h2>
	<p></p>

	<hr>

  <p>In Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Dr M'Benga puts his daughter, Rukiya, fatally ill with about twelve weeks to live, into the medical transporter in stasis. In Foundation, Hari Seldon uploads his digital self to a computer on the Raven upon his death, and speaks to Gaal when she arrives to the ship. In Devs, Forest's Devs team works on a quantum computer that allows them to view the past; Forest frequently watches his now deceased daughter Amaya blow bubbles via the machine.
  <p>So the ghosts are Rukiya, Hari, and Amaya. The machines are a medical transporter, a ship computer, and a quantum computer. The hauntees (?) are M'Benga, Hari himself, and Forest.</p>

<p>A. Are the Ghosts dead?</p>

<p>Hari and Amaya are both definitely physically dead. Rukiya is technically still alive, but in stasis. I think you could argue that narratively, a child that cannot grow up in any meaningful way is not really alive, either. On the other hand, Hari's case is presented as more of "immortality via technology" case. If the digitized version of himself still has all his memories and motivations, is he not still alive? Amaya is also definitely dead in Forest's world, but in the multiverse, there are many worlds where she still lives.</p>

<p>B. Are the Ghosts even in the Machine?</p>

<p>Rukiya is usually in the machine. Hari is dependent on the machine, but he gets to walk around too. Amaya isn't in the machine per se but is only visible via the machine.</p>

<p>C. Are the Ghosts trapped?</p>

<p>By definition I think ghosts should be trapped. The whole point is that they aren't alive anymore, but they also can't "move on." Rukiya is mostly trapped; if she leaves the machine she dies, unless M'Benga can find a way to cure her disease. Hari is somewhat trapped&mdash;his digitized self travels to Terminus. Amaya is extremely trapped, dead in the past. And if Forest is right and the universe is totally deterministic, then Amaya is not only trapped but also was always going to be trapped, i.e., doomed. Okay trapped doesn't even look like a real word anymore.</p>

<p>D. Why can't they move on?</p>

<p>So M'Benga put Rukiya into the machine, Forest keeps Amaya's memory alive in the machine. It's not that the daughters can't or won't move on, it's the fathers. Which is also probably unhealthy for both of them. Hari did it to himself, uploaded himself. He's got plans and he means to see them through, and a little thing like death isn't going to stop him. So there's this element of control- by putting Rukiya into the transporter M'Benga regains control over a situation (daughter dying of disease) that is/was out of his control (because he can't cure her) because now he can control how she experiences time. Hari gains control over death by in some sense escaping it. Forest is trying to control a totally uncontrollable system, quantum mechanics, by being able to observe it. Also there's this element of hubris&mdash;to control the uncontrollable. And it's not just the Ghosts who can't move on, it's the Hauntees too&mdash;M'Benga can't let his daughter go, Hari can't trust anyone else to finish his plans, Forest can't move on from his daughter's death.</p>

<p>E. How do the Ghosts experience time?</p>

<p>Rukiya experiences time in bursts. Mostly she's in stasis, and when M'Benga brings her out she experiences time normally, as part of the living world. Hari initially has an issue with his digitization and loops his death over and over again. But once that's sorted, presumably he also experiences time somewhat normally? But also, as a digital representation, he maybe has infinite time. Probably he can hibernate? Probably he can't die again unless his program is destroyed? Amaya experienced time normally. Although she sort of loops too, since Forest mostly watches that same scene of her blowing bubbles over and over. The person who really has an interesting experience with time is Forest, who's obsessed with his past. An also maybe future but that's a separate point. And all three Ghosts become Ghosts because they don't have enough time- Rukiya because she's dying, Hari and Amaya because they're already dead.</p>

<p>F. Do the Ghosts have agency in the world?</p>

<p>Rukiya mostly no, she's terminally ill and hidden on the Enterprise. But she can interact with M'Benga normally when she's out of stasis. Hari yes, that was the whole point of his becoming a Ghost in the first place. Amaya not at all, her machine is a one way mirror into the past, and anything she does is something that has already happened in the past and cannot be changed.</p>

<p>G. Where did the Machine come from?</p>

<p>The medical transporter is a pretty standard piece of Star Trek tech. The Machine isn't the interesting part, here, and can be used for other things. Probably Hari designed or at least implemented his digitization? His Machine is more interesting than the transporter, but it's mostly treated as an extension of Hari himself. Forest's team builds the quantum computer, and so the focus is just as much on the Machine as it is on the Ghost. Also, there are many Ghosts in that Machine, but narratively Amaya is the most important.

<p>H. How close is the Ghost to the living person?</p>

<p>Rukiya is of course still alive. Hari I think is ambiguous. His digital self is supposed to have all the memories and personality he had when he was alive, but is it really him? Does a program have the ability to grow and change like a human can? Is it really Hari or just an echo? When Lyndon and later Katie implements the many worlds algorithms&mdash;is the Amaya Forest sees on screen his Amaya? Or another one from another universe?</p>

<p>okay that was my actually thought out thoughts, here's the uh stream of consciousness notes section<p>
  EP 1
<br><br>
did we ever figure out what was Up with those obelisks that appeared? was that an art project?
<br><br>
oooo elliptic curves. I gotta find that textbook on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems.
<br><br>
mm georgean chanting (?) when they walk into devs like religion => like they're playing gods
<br><br>
what's with the watch???
<br><br>
so my first guess would have been that they proved multiverse theory, except forest said he wasn't a fan of that theory. or maybe he's just not a fan of other worlds?
<br><br>
second thought is they created actual artificial intelligence. and the giant girl is the like physical avatar of that. so his work with the nematodes was him showing he could handle it
<br><br>
oh my god did they prove that there's no free will? maybe they're computing the future. hence katie's comment that "it doesn't change anything"
<br><br>
oh the watch stole the code. or recorded it.
<br><br>
"YOU COULD HAVE ONLY DONE WHAT YOU DID" IM SCREAMING
<br><br>
oh no are they gonna kill my boy sergei. oh sergi :(
<br><br>
wait so. if they're computing the future. is he basically saying that they always knew they were going to kill him?? so they just gave him the promotion and did all that stuff knowing??
<br><br>
oh lily babe :(
<br><br>
wiping and resetting a phone- she wanted to know what was on it from the last backup?? man she went into detective mode like Right Away
<br><br>
hm did forest's kid die? is that who that giant girl is?
<br><br>
jeez is katie really like "yeah isn't it so sad that we murdered that guy like poor us we didn't even have a choice :("
<br><br>
oh jamie :(
<br><br>
oh ho ho she did the praying hands. a la "most logical person will start praying when their child is in danger".
<br><br>
oh wow does lily suck? maybe she kind of sucks!
<br><br>
okay but that's a really smart way of covering up a body, just fake video of him setting himself on fire and then burn the body. no muss no fuss no autopsy.
<br><br>
I feel like lily's killer mental math skills are going to make an appearance again.
<br><br>
lmao I am not surprised one bit to see that the director and writer for this is the ex machina guy
<br><br>
EP 2
<br><br>
okay so what's the significance of where they burn sergei's body? at the feet of giant girl? like a sacrifice?
<br><br>
oh okay so forest's daughter definitely died. oh the whole company is named after her.
<br><br>
huh okay so that's why he doesn't like the multiverse theory. because he says when she died he felt like he was split into two states.
<br><br>
huh he's being so nice to her!
<br><br>
hm so forest has dogs, fish. left her room as is because of course he did.
<br><br>
ah yes we love an emotionally unhelpful immigrant mother.
<br><br>
yo that's a nice apartment for san francisco right
<br><br>
literally why does she think jamie can do anything about that. like obviously brute force is no good. she's the best person to try and guess it.
<br><br>
what the flying fuck is that a person on the machine screen?? HOLY FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE JESUS ON THE CROSS WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY LOOKING INTO THE PAST
<br><br>
I mean if you can extrapolate forwards why not extrapolate back
<br><br>
why does sergei message his theoretically russian handler in english lmao
<br><br>
"don't feel invaded no one has a private life anymore" lmao
<br><br>
omg he wants to see his daughter again I bet
<br><br>
oh called it! oh is that the weird hand position on the statue? she's blowing bubbles? hm, is that those glowing rings around the trees? the bubbles?
<br><br>
the mortifying ideal of being knowwwnnnnnn jamie knowing that lily would absolutely use the app
<br><br>
EP 3
<br><br>
we have two rules: only look back never forwards, and we don't invade privacy. so like guarantee they're gonna break those rules lol. has katie already looked forward? to know what sergei did?
<br><br>
so is it gonna rain tomorrow? doesn't look like it oooooo I love u doublespeak
<br><br>
lily maybe has schizophrenia ?? is jen for real??
<br><br>
WHAT WHAT BROOKLYN WHAT
<br><br>
omg JEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH KEN'S COMPUTER
<br><br>
OH MY GOD JEN IS IN ON IT.
<br><br>
also how tf did they come up with a plan that fast?
<br><br>
EP 4
<br><br>
who is forest watching on the screen? is that sergei in death or lily in the future?
<br><br>
HMM lily stayed the niiiight
<br><br>
huh okay def future
<br><br>
"I'M SCARED WE MAY BE MAGICIANS"?????
<br><br>
also, at this point lily and jamie have no idea what devs even does right?
<br><br>
what's up with the homeless guy and why isn't he scared of kenton? also has anyone even told him that sergei is dead?
<br><br>
"are you close with your mother?" "more or less" "what does that mean?" "I don't know. we act close" I'M FUCKING SCREAMING LILY
<br><br>
okay so is jamie gonna try and win her back and that's why he's fixing up his place?
<br><br>
okay so if lyndon swaps it for many worlds, how can he possibly know if he has the right world? we want to know what X said in this world. oh okay forest is on the same page. also, side note, I loved that actor in bad times at the el royale so love to see them here. also I love him and stewart's friendship
<br><br>
oh jesus fuck FUCK INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATIONS
<br><br>
oh fucking power move, katie was really like "are you gonna fire me too asshole"
<br><br>
also. why is the "deeply damaged older man grieving the loss of a loved one" always obsessed with a wife or daughter. like it's never a son. or a husband. or a brother or best friend. I suppose counterpoint is silent sea, with song ji-an. she was obsessed with her dead sister.
<br><br>
KENTON IF YOU HURT JAMIE !!!!!! oh fuck oh fuck
<br><br>
EP 5
<br><br>
oh i'm loving this multiverse apartment scene
<br><br>
symbolism of the go scene ? => lily acts intuitively ?
<br><br>
hm okay so she didn't meet sergei until after she broke up with jamie
<br><br>
"I'm in love with you" "Whoa." LMAO. "cool" LMAO
<br><br>
lecture on quantum mechanics&mdash; okay so if they're observing the past, does that mean changing the past?
<br><br>
WAIT OKAY SO DOES THAT MEAN MAYBE FOREST WANTS TO BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE PAST SO THAT HE CAN CHANGE IT SO THAT HE CAN GET HIS DAUGHTER BACK
<br><br>
what are these objects? rat, sugar cube, clock, shell. oh shit is this like the infinite perspective machine from hitchhiker's guide?
<br><br>
GHOST IN THE MACHINE GHOST IN THE MACHINE
<br><br>
oh my GOD he had to watch her die just like that. and presumably he thinks it was his fault, because maybe he distracted her while driving. ah yup katie's on the same page.
<br><br>
JAMIE TO THE RESCUE!!!! lol they're always climbing through windows. wait but katie knows??
