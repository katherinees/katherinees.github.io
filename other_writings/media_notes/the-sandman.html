  EP 1
<br><br>
is that a human sacrifice??
<br><br>
daddy issues for alex?
<br><br>
magdalene grimoire => mary magdalene? how does dr hathaway have it? if this book was all they needed, why wouldn't they have idk tried to steal it before?
<br><br>
how much other magic have these fools done?
<br><br>
this dude really does not care about alex
<br><br>
1 million affected, what's the world pop at this time? 1916 right? approx 1.9 billion
<br><br>
alex becomes glorified manservant :( what does he think about dream? pity? guilt?
<br><br>
who is ethel? friend of magus? had she met alex before that party?
<br><br>
that's a loyal bird
<br><br>
OMFG JESSAMINE NOOOOOOOOO
<br><br>
ALEXXXX WHYY
<br><br>
what must dream think of alex
<br><br>
is ethel fucking the magus????? does she want to keep the baby???
<br><br>
hmm that's two beings alex has killed. what's next for him. is he death??
<br><br>
okay but who is ethel? is she a magician too?
<br><br>
who is paul? he doesn't know anything.
<br><br>
oh hello timeskip. oooooo sneaky paul.
<br><br>
over a century?? just how old was alex??
<br><br>
who is lucienne? how did she survive when everything else is decaying?
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 2
<br><br>
lucienne, jessamine, this dude knows how to inspire some Loyalty. love that for him.
<br><br>
is this older ethel or someone new? anyway, goals. hm paranoid. well of course you would be with that much high quality art. ah okay ethel. okay but where's the baby?
<br><br>
"surely it hasn't come to that" lucienne his kingdom is totally broken. so lucienne doesn't trust the fates, dream doesn't trust his siblings. but none of them helped, so fair.
<br><br>
cain and abel????????????????? quoi de fuck? i mean like presumably not biblically accurate right??
<br><br>
"i have come to ask gregory" :(
<br><br>
wait what did that brother actually die??
<br><br>
ah yes we LOVE a three in one goddess mother maiden crone :) omg "sister-self"!! mm yes eat that symbol of transformation
<br><br>
is it a gargoyle egg for cain and abel????
<br><br>
"ruby took john" vague but okay. lots of things to do with dead sons. &mdash;oh, not dead
<br><br>
aw I kinda thought they'd take turns killing each other
<br><br>
abel!!! "this is who we are, the first murderer, the first victim"!!! "do you even know what a story is?" !!!
<br><br>
doesn't want a raven because there aren't any and he doesn't want anyone else to get hurt
<br><br>
okay so if gregory had said no, would dream have had to absorb the power from lucienne? because she is also a dream, also something he created? or is she something else?
<br><br>
also. if gregory had been human, were all ravens previously humans? even jasmine?
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 3
<br><br>
i bet hettie is actually 280 and that wasn't a joke
<br><br>
oo she's so proud. confidence and self interest.
<br><br>
why does john want to start again? and let his mom in on it? does ethel actually want to give the ruby back or what?
<br><br>
mm okay we got the Guilt Figure, the tragic badass with a dead girl in her past
<br><br>
so far i feel like dream hasn't lied much at all. he answers questions. he's mysterious but he says things.
<br><br>
im so confused by ethel/john's relationship. like there's no way they've patched up so fast. is john being a lil evil? but ethel does seem to love him?
<br><br>
!! rachel doesn't even seem that mad ?? oh my GOD. oh shit it was just a dream. oh noooo, another dead girl for johanna to mourn :(
<br><br>
okay fair point johanna. a hundred years in a basement for dream, no wonder he doesn't trust the humans. but he needs to, because dreams are integral to humanity.
<br><br>
one last dream before death.
<br><br>
"i hope it keeps you alive forever, that's all a mother wants". seriously?? who wants to live forever?? oh holy shit that's a strong amulet.
<br><br>
hmmmm if you cannot be hurt, if you cannot die, if the source of your immortality forcibly kills anyone who tries to hurt you whether you will it or not. if you cannot be hurt => you aren't human.
<br><br>
did corinthian just pickpocket him??
<br><br>
johanna has a v low opinion of herself. but dream still says: "you are not rodrick burgess".
<br><br>
"fuck it, let's go to hell" :)
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 4
<br><br>
dream's very like upright. protocols. humility. truth.
<br><br>
KAI'CKUL??? wait what the FUCK. what did she do??? also. dream's avatar changes?? well okay if she's 10000 years old yeah of course dream wouldn't have looked like a skinny white man. "she defied me"?? this all feels very at odds with how dream has been presented so far.
<br><br>
god that's a gorgeous shot of dream walking in the gates, one narrow strip of light against black walls.
<br><br>
dream smiles more talking to lucifer than he has thus far. uncomfortable? trying to be polite? also lucifer's costuming is a bit tragic. looks cheap.
<br><br>
these are some fucked up rules for challenges. if the laws of hell demand lucifer is the champion, really you could kill anyone by going "i challenge you and also name lucifer as my champion". like what.
<br><br>
chekov's gun sign. oh this is a very stressful night for rosemary.
<br><br>
oh corinthian didn't pickpocket him. so what was the thing with the coat.
<br><br>
so this challenge is not a battle? lucifer is actually doing horribly i feel like. where is the imagination. "what kills hope?" yo like a lot of things actually.
<br><br>
i feel like there are a moment there with mazikeen?
<br><br>
"what power would hell have if those here imprisoned were not able to dream of heaven?" fucking raw.
<br><br>
lots of titles around here. lightbringer. lord dream. wonder what his last visit was like. also, we've seen that dream's appearance can change. presumably his helm also didn't always look like that?
<br><br>
literally why wouldn't rosemary just fucking run??
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 5
<br><br>
interesting bette character. she's weirdly invested in other people's relationships, awkwardly flirting with marsh. a hint of homophobic. when john forces bette to tell the truth, she says she wants him to like her. but would a person who wants to be liked cause problems on purpose with the couple? or she only wants to be nice to the people she doesn't know yet/haven't wronged her?
<br><br>
time loop??? is bette controlling it? bette thinks she knows best? are we meant to like her or not??? whose dream is this?? like marsh seems like he's telling the truth, the mark kid, what the fuck is happening with kate??
<br><br>
sex dream?? whose dream is this?? is desire in town?? making them all tell the truth turned everything crazy??
<br><br>
they all destroy their hands!!! if you must speak the truth and you must hear it, at least do no evil?? see no evil?? YIKES. the women become the fates?? when they say he will destroy john, is it true?
<br><br>
so the jewel was only ever a repository of energy??? how and why did dream put â€˜so much of himself' into the jewel in the first place?? he is endless and eternal and cannot be destroyed !!! john was out of his league the ENTIRE fucking time and he had no idea !!
<br><br>
does he need to make a new ruby?
<br><br>
when do people dream? if you asked everyone in the world every morning "hey do you remember your dream last night" do you think there'd be any patterns??
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 6
<br><br>
where was she when he was trapped in the cage?? especially since she knew they were looking for her?? does she feel guilty about it at all??
<br><br>
mad hettie??? so death just. doesn't come for her? she knows about dream, who is she?
<br><br>
the purpose is the function => what is a standalone dream? you need the dreamer too
<br><br>
hobbie is like dream's anchor to humanity, proof that the endless can be good
<br><br>
insulted by the insinuation that he needs friends??
<br><br>
everything cycles back again.
<br><br>
desire made the plan to trap dream?????? did death know????
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 7
<br><br>
nada was despair and desire's plan?? desire is the instigator, which makes sense, of course despair is going to be pessimistic
<br><br>
okay i spy seven windows in desire's lair (?): book = destiny?, ankh = death, raven mask = dream, mirror = desire, can't tell what the other two things are but must be despair, + one more. and a blank spot for the prodigal?
<br><br>
dream vortex?? important that it's a woman?? was nada a dream vortex too? pretty rare?
<br><br>
return of the sleeping unity! can rose make things come true too? was unity a vortex? who did she meet in her dreams? who was miranda's father? how did rose know judy?
<br><br>
okay so rose is a badass
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 8
<br><br>
okay very rare, dream vortexes only once/few thousand years. how are they made?
<br><br>
okay but jed is having dreams, why can't dream just find him? is gault bernard?
<br><br>
there's no way that's her husband, right?? gault?
<br><br>
what are the corinthian's eyes like under the glasses?
<br><br>
do we like gault?? has she been giving jed a little bit of happiness? oh shit but she's bad at it bc fundamentally she's a nightmare
<br><br>
dream pulling rose out of the dream before she can confirm where jeb is, telling lucienne to go back to the library, sentencing gault to darkness. all seems uncharacteristically harsh for dream as we've seen him so far. is this him coming back into power? spooked by the vortex? what is up my dude
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 9
<br><br>
lmao @ cereal convention
<br><br>
gilbert is maybe a dream? or a nightmare?
<br><br>
is the dream cracking because rose is physically further away? or is rose destroying the dreaming
<br><br>
"i assumed the earthquake was you." I.e. i see you as something destructive, and dream wants to be seen as something creative/constructive
<br><br>
okay so hector is definitely fiddler's green right??
<br><br>
sure tell a boy who's been locked in a basement for ages not to open a door. like that'll work.
<br><br>
gilbert def recognized the corinthian right. ah nope okay gilbert is fiddler's green
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 10
<br><br>
an entire universe was lost !!!! wtf !! is that what happened with nada i need to know!!
<br><br>
mouths for eyes wtf !!! what's the lil skull??
<br><br>
okay but also what's up with unity? how could she wake up when no one else could?
<br><br>
"i was not a person, i was a place" !!!! come rest with me !!
<br><br>
desire is rose's great grandfather??????? all desire all the time? does desire create vortexes? vortex = manifestation of the dream, of the want, of the desire
<br><br>
jeb quoting the corinthian ?
<br><br>
okay so they all have their own galleries with sigils? does it mean something that desire's heart looks just like unity's dream vortex thingie??
<br><br>
if an endless spills another endless's blood, what happens? poor delirium? is that the prodigal? okay but why does desire have it out for dream so much?
<br><br>
dream fixing his mistakes and relationships!!! dream knows he has to change and move on and evolve!!
