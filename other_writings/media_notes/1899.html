  EP 1
<br><br>
is this a poem from somewhere? i'm getting emily dickinson vibes. HOLY SHIT IM A GENIUS it is emily dickinson. okay anyway, emily dickinson. era appropriate. lesbian, shut in vibes. themes of imagination despite feeling trapped.
<br><br>
are you asleep and do you remember and where are you. she puts the photo of the prometheus (bound, chained, tortured, tried to give humanity light and fire and got punished eternally for it) over a diagram of the brain.
<br><br>
how many brothers? the letter is addressed to henry, from a brother. grounding statements. "i am maura. i am not crazy"
<br><br>
theme song refs alice in wonderland. another girl who travels in imagination.
<br><br>
french, chinese, spanish, polish, english, danish, german. everyone taking a sip at the same time???? that's so fucking cool !!!!
<br><br>
[later: wait okay so i'm listening to mindscape ep 41 w steven strogatz and he's talking about how firefly flashes get in sync. what if they're in sync somehow. because in the next episode beetles pop up, so maybe they're part of some organism/organization somehow?????]
<br><br>
lower class man begs for help and the old stupid doctor does nothing because obviously. there's something on the ship?
<br><br>
is there something weird about the baby?? other woman says it's god's baby, is that just a general child of god thing or is there something up with that baby? because the brother was like "you're killing us" so. i vote it's a creepy baby.
<br><br>
i feel a black man on a ship with almost all white passengers in 1899 is in danger.
<br><br>
the fucking audacity of lucien
<br><br>
what does polish boiler room guy know? he's worried about them turning the ship. has a photo of the statue of liberty
<br><br>
spanish brothers afraid of going back, right after the non-priest was like "i have no fear"
<br><br>
german captain has a photo of a family, and a chekov's gun probably. his letter addressed to eyk has an envelope exactly the same as maura's henry letter. "what is lost, will be found"
<br><br>
why doesn't mrs wilson want the chinese women to talk??
<br><br>
hm ship name is kerberos. who named these?
<br><br>
the crew seem afraid of the prometheus and what might be on it. what do they think could be on it? the first mate doesn't want them to go. they want the priest to go?? is the priest really a priest or is it a disguise?
<br><br>
god the isolation and fear of not fucking understanding anything that's going on because no one speaks your language
<br><br>
well this is homoerotic. but also the freedom to say whatever the hell you want because no one speaks your language. where's the scar from?
<br><br>
this ship looks in way worse shape than i would expect for only having been missing for four months. or does the humidity and cold of the sea make the deterioration faster?
<br><br>
eyk recognizes the embroidery?
<br><br>
did that person just crawl out of the fucking ocean?????? is the ship a decoy, a bait? where do you get an iridescent beetle in the middle of the ocean?
<br><br>
1011 that's something, right? 11 in binary?
<br><br>
what's with the beetle? a curse? does the mystery man control them? what's with the pyramid??
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 2
<br><br>
eyk's family died in a fire? assuming this is memory not wild dream. does no one on this ship sleep in pajamas? (maura woke up from a nap also already dressed.) he kept the embroidery
<br><br>
how sure are we that the message from the company is actually from the company?
<br><br>
they're in no man's land. the compasses are all broken. lost at sea, baby!!
<br><br>
is the pyramid protection? a key? it looks beat up, maybe. or just old? the show logo has an upside down pyramid
<br><br>
"or maybe wolves" "do you know how many wolves it takes to kill 1000 people?" lmao my dudes where would the wolves come from???? also i hope they're right
<br><br>
captain is asking some good questions
<br><br>
that man is definitely not the neighbor, right? i thought he was the one who came out of the sea?
<br><br>
is j&eacute;r&ocirc;me a stowaway? what's with the medal? did cl&eacute;mence recognize it? is j&eacute;r&ocirc;me delivering it for someone?
<br><br>
trapped in a memory. eyk's wife is haunted by shadows- cf the danish sister talking about shadows in a ship. the beetle's back!! too brightly colored for the grays of the ship. it's the white rabbit?
<br><br>
!!! the upside down triangle on the secret door!! whose cabin is this??
<br><br>
okay creepy boy has the triangle tattoo behind his ear, and when maura goes to ask he motions for her to be silent, right after maura says "i was mad at him for taking away the one moment i thought i wasn't being watched." so. is the boy somehow connected to something Else, listening in? and that's why he doesn't want to talk?
<br><br>
is that spider embroidery on cl&eacute;mence's neck collar??? that's cool as hell. oooooo j&eacute;r&ocirc;me's using tu with her !!
<br><br>
okay so how does a portuguese servant end up posing as angel's priest brother. holy shit what's up with angel's back??
<br><br>
oh the marks are on the carpets too. did maura notice?
<br><br>
daniel has a photo of maura?? THEYRE BEING FUCKING WATCHED?????
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 3
<br><br>
okay so the triangle is on ling ye's robe. was it always there? marking her as property
<br><br>
"sometimes we misinterpret those impulses" sure but the ribbon is real and in her hand, right?
<br><br>
she's pretending to be a different prostitute?? is she taking someone else's place? oh yes.
<br><br>
oh so is maura married? or was she? if she had a miscarriage in the past? "why are you afraid to go back home?" "because i lost everything" lost baby, lost husband (?), lost family? natural miscarriage or did something happen to her?
<br><br>
lost at sea. compasses broken, fog. was this what happens to the prometheus too? were they drawn off course by something too?
<br><br>
ah yes the trope of the woman in the box. what does olek think ling yi was doing? he helps her hide though
<br><br>
tove with her hair down. i feel like a woman of her social class/age should not have her hair down like this in 1899? oh it's a pieta parallel, carrying her sister in her arms
<br><br>
angel and krester. through a grate, speaking of masks, can't verbally communicate, only actions. hm, krester name origin is follower of christ. and angel is angel of course. is angel an angel to krester? dressed in fancy white clothes, speaking in tongues, knows about krester's desires.
<br><br>
are the prometheus and kerberos laid out exactly the same? at least there's the same weird trap door in both captain's quarters. should i interpret this black glossy tile as being anachronistic? idk enough about 19th century building materials to say. a tunnel out of time?
<br><br>
the beetle comes before daniel. wait okay is there a possibility that creepy boy is daniel but younger?? wait never mind, different colored eyes. but they know each other&mdash;daniel asks if he's "found it".
<br><br>
wait. henry singleton. coincidence that maura's envelope is also addressed to henry?? same henry? maura = maura singleton, maybe?
<br><br>
the fog comes into the hold (?) area where ling yi is. is the fog. magic?? or drugs?? also. a couple pairings now where people don't speak the same language, but are trying to communicate&mdash;ling yi in cantonese versus olek in polish, angel and krester. oh okay so mei mei was supposed to be the prostitute on the prometheus?? was a friend of ling yi's? and she killed her. by accident.
<br><br>
what does olek think is happening?? "we are not supposed to have dreams" says ling yi. is that like a generic expression of pessimism like "dreams unfilled hurt, so we shouldn't dream of better times, because trying to reach them and failing hurts, and trying to reach them causes pain e.g. accidentally murdering a friend"? or is that a specific "i was promised by someone that by doing whatever it is that i am doing on this boat i wouldn't have dreams of these terrible memories"? is olek aware that she is supposed to be a prostitute?
<br><br>
ah yes the terrible awkwardness of coming back from your secret handjob to find your dead sister. what's behind the door he's trying to open/why is it locked? "we have to open the window or her soul won't leave"
<br><br>
oh shit more dead people. so. is this what happened on the prometheus? people slowing dropping dead? but i thought daniel killed tove's sister
<br><br>
maura thinks they burned all the bodies?? a book????? there's no way that should have been able to survive if the thing was on. so someone threw it in later? but eyk hides it from maura. because he saw a name on it?
<br><br>
lucien has a hand tremor, and a black edged envelope too. what was in the vial that he didn't want cl&eacute;mence to see?
<br><br>
virginia has cash, and a black edged envelope.
<br><br>
ling yi wearing the kimono to perform for lucien. but ling yi speaks cantonese so i feel like i can assume she's chinese and kimonos are japanese, right? is she just performing exoticism for a white man who can't tell the difference? or is there something happening there?
<br><br>
so lucien. doesn't want to have sex with her? is lucien having a seizure?? also. seems to be echoing ling yi's "we're not supposed to have dreams" motto
<br><br>
bloody faced sailor man brings up a good point. the company told them to sink the prometheus, and his theory is that they didn't want whatever was on the prometheus getting out. so. is the prometheus a failed experiment of some kind?
<br><br>
hm. tove knows how to load/shoot a gun. a bit unexpected.
<br><br>
ramiro's facial hair looks like the triangle symbol. hm ramiro killed someone too. and so did ling yi. did they all? a ship of murderers?
<br><br>
hmmmmmm maura's name is on the prometheus manifest. so. was she supposed to be there and never made it, and that's why she's so invested in it? or is maura not really maura at all, somebody else pretending to be her?
<br><br>
"as if someone sent this fog on purpose" i bet daniel is telling the truth. someone sent that fog on purpose
<br><br>
ramiro tries to warn eyk, but eyk can't speak portuguese. once again, trying to help but unable to communicate
<br><br>
daniel's got a fancy thing. it looks like one of those fifteen slider puzzles, seems to connect to the weird machine that was supposed to keep track of the fuel. which seems wildly too advanced for 1899&mdash;wireless devices?? holy shit. did daniel just disappear the kerebos??
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 4
<br><br>
sand dunes!! oceans of sand in contrast to a ship on the water! idk enough about late 19th c world history to know where this is supposed to be happening. is this egypt or something? or is that lucien? "come back to reality my friend" hm. okay so lucien's framed as a bit of a coward, j&eacute;r&ocirc;me is the loyal soldier.
<br><br>
also. so far everyone's only been dreaming of memories. are we going to get any true dream sequences?
<br><br>
hm a lot of dead people on board. so franz thinks maybe they died of some disease, if he doesn't want to touch the bodies and makes olek and j&eacute;r&ocirc;me do it instead. also. i though daniel disappeared one of the ships at the end of last episode. are we going to talk about that or what? oh okay yes.
<br><br>
subtitled norwegian and russian. this is truly a cosmopolitan boat. is that. normal?
<br><br>
they were facing east, now they're facing west. they've been reset to their earlier position.
<br><br>
tove doesn't want to translate what the crew guy said about the creepy boy causing the deaths. is tove sympathetic to the boy? iben puts her hand on tove's stomach. i still want to know what is up with her baby. also, tove's not married, right?
<br><br>
why is ramiro helping eyk? like what's his motivation here? doesn't he want to get to america too?
<br><br>
okay so what's wrong with lucien exactly? like he's playing the bastard, is he just not dealing well with the fact that he's dying? related to his war memories? a massive case of karma?
<br><br>
"god doesn't talk to me like he does to your mother". literally?? why doesn't tove want to creepy boy to be evil? because if the boy is evil, then her unborn baby is also evil? with her hair down => sign of unmarried woman (??) => are we supposed to see her as a mary figure?
<br><br>
crawling through the tunnels on the ship :) one of my fav tropes
<br><br>
superstitious coal shoveler i looove youuu
<br><br>
olek i love you too. always trying to help even though he has no idea what's going on or what anyone is saying to him ever. this breathy chanting is great too. v atmospheric
<br><br>
nice hairpin cl&eacute;mence!! upside down triangle appears once more
<br><br>
oh angel you stupid boy getting krester in trouble. "i wish he had taken you instead of ada" fucking cold thing to say to your son. i feel like the subtext her is that krester has been caught with a man before, like the mom definitely knows
<br><br>
oh so creepy boy also has the iridescent beetles, like daniel. oh the carpet !! lmao no one can fucking stay put on this ship
<br><br>
a traumatized german captain, fake portuguese priest, french veteran, and the best dressed lady on board, unite !
<br><br>
okay so j&eacute;r&ocirc;me put the medal in lucien's cabin. to remind him? to warn? threaten? and lucien throws it into the ocean, like j&eacute;r&ocirc;me and olek threw bodies into the ocean.
<br><br>
why was it necessary for lucien to lock j&eacute;r&ocirc;me away to go back as a lieutenant? why did he want to be on board? get revenge on lucien?
<br><br>
they all go mad. why does daniel care about maura?
<br><br>
maura: "like he accepted it was coming." did the boy know it was coming?? OH SHIT THE BOY'S IN THE CABINET JUST LIKE ON THE PROMETHEUS. he hugs maura ?????
