  WE'RE BACK BABY
<br><br>
  i'm gonna be honest here i really do not remember much of the end of season one just because so so much happened and i didn't do media notes like this back then but hopefully that's not too big an issue
<br><br>
  oh thank fuck, a recap
<br><br>
  this has big "monologue on an empty stage" energy. is the. program that contains hari corrupted in some way? dude does not look like he is having a good time.
<br><br>
  salvor to gaal: "mom feels a little loaded" so true. just how far into the future did they sleep?
<br><br>
  day is fucking demerzel ??????? that's her right?? the mother figure who killed dawn ??? and then immediately using her as a shield ? what the FUCK SIR
<br><br>
  also god. she's really everything to him.
<br><br>
  flashbacks to hari as a child, playing with shadows. four dimensional object, three dimensional shape. we're all shadows, it's true. => and that's how you break out of the mirror triangle prison, by realizing there is an outside to break out to. who is this not-yanna ??
<br><br>
  shadows, math, creations, traps, seeing, knowing. the whole shadows thing feels like a plato's cave reference&mdash;up a level. if all you know and see is three dimensional, how do you conceptualize the idea that maybe your entire world is nothing more than the projection of a four dimensional thing? so if hari is able to make that conceptual leap, that's why he's able to figure out the prime radiant math/do his statistical predictions.
<br><br>
  and visually, the prime radiant just looks like some kind of hyper dimensional object, with the way all the vertices are connected like that. and yet he's trapped inside it, trapped inside his own creation. so making that conceptual leap wasn't enough&mdash;he's still trapped in some kind of cave?
<br><br>
  hari is bound to the prime radiant, to his own creation. his creation of psychohistory in season one elevated him to god-status, kind of, and yet now he's trapped. kind of a reoccurring theme with him. he knows (or thinks he knows) what's going to happen, and he can kind of do something about it, but he's also trapped by his plan. foundation definitely does play around with fate in interesting ways&mdash;is the universe doomed, or isn't it?
<br><br>
  reminds me of some of those philosophical arguments about the existence of god. is hari omniscient? arguably yes. omnipotent? definitely not. benevolent? well. hari would probably say he's doing everything for the benefit of humankind, and yet and yet.
<br><br>
  on trantor&mdash;god imagine living in the shadow of your prophet. like he's just !! right there !!
<br><br>
  two haris??? that's two too many
<br><br>
  okay okay so this is a new dawn, right? because demerzel killed the old one. but it's not the one the rebels grew, is it? or no never mind it's been too many years. did we ever find out what happened to that clone though?
<br><br>
  the assassin had no eyes?????? day's getting married?? he wants to have a kid?? is his earring changing sides?? so many questions
<br><br>
  oh i'd be so dead i can't hold my breath for shit. holy shit i feel like this plan should not have worked at all but i'm happy it did
<br><br>
  oh okay day is cleon xvii. aw dusk is still an artist
<br><br>
  so now not-kalle is the one pulling hari's strings? interesting interesting.
<br><br>
  the ghost in the machine is OUT and he's MAD
<br><br></div>
<hr><br><br>
S02E02<br><br>
"i was conscious the entire time" says hari. holy shit, how long was that, again?? as long as salvor has been alive at least right? can she be forgiven for acting thoughtlessly??
<br><br>
oooo i love a split clone trope. who is who and what does it mean if the two parts of yourself are in conflict?
<br><br>
i Also love a wall of water wave trope :) holy shit what a visual. oh, above the storms it's sunny & beautiful. it's all gonna be okay :)
<br><br>
hello lil red riding hood. the hungover man says "dear seldon" as in hari ?? and once again the teachings of the math of hari seldon are put in opposition to religions. the red-cloaks don't seem particularly devout (?) though
<br><br>
"or more precisely, they don't remember hiring someone to kill you" love u demerzel. "they'll have no recollection of seeing us so compromised." sooo interesting that she can do that!! also shows how she is so instrumental in day's projection of himself as absolute. he would be so epically screwed if she ever decided to move against him&mdash;he trusts her even more than his brothers, who are now separate from himself
<br><br>
oh there's something so chilling about demerzel lowering her arms when day walks away. she's making eye contact with one of the old empresses, whom day said was so great. what's up with that???? (demerzel pre-dates cleon, right? i think i remember in season one that she was like ten thousand years old. so she would remember the ancient empress, the rise and fall of that dynasty?)
<br><br>
whomst the fuck is this old lady to tell them how to eat? oh holy shit is she telling them how to be more like cleon i?? yup yup yup. god but that shows so well the tiny cracks in the perfection of empire
<br><br>
"you said the math was off-course, so let's fix it" says salvor. interesting to see her practicality against hari's (and to a lesser extent gaal's) theoretics
<br><br>
huh interesting to see dawn/day/dusk attempt to be charming. even though dawn & dusk still don't approve of this marriage? sareth seems a trouble maker
<br><br>
"assassination by procreation" what a juxtaposition. which kind of also drives the point home&mdash;with genetic drift, the cleonic tree is already dead. marriage and a biological offspring is the tree's last ditch attempt at life. and if he does it this way, no one will ever ever know that there was a drift to begin with.
<br><br>
asexual versus sexual reproduction. pros & cons. generally sexual reproduction is "fitter" right? or is that a very animalia-centric view?
<br><br>
also. why doesn't the current day just say fuck cleon i, i'm the blueprint now. he's close enough to cleon i that no one outside of dawn/day/dusk would be able to tell. and that solves the problem of genetic drift.
<br><br>
oh i like the colors of this sivenna
<br><br>
fancy magic show they've got on. they're proselytizing? hm. bit gross not going to lie. "one of the worst punishments is having your wish come true."
<br><br>
as they're jumping this reminds me&mdash;we never did find out why gaal was able to stay awake during jumps.
<br><br>
"150 years upstream??" "why not?" lmao great question salvor. aw she's counting primes again. man gaal REALLY plays fast & loose with her own life. she's just constantly jumping headfirst into danger. does she believe she's indestructible? she just calculates the odds and decides she's fine?
<br><br>
circles and circles, the self-fulfilling prophecy. looking forward, looking back. and once again, how fixed is the future??
<br><br>
WAIT THAT'S POLY??? the lil boy from s01?? also. how is he so old and yet doesn't look that old? "are they deadly? no wait, are they expensive?" fuck yeah poly
<br><br>
brother constant doesn't look anything like sermak. maybe to be expected if they're still doing the whole sperm + egg + surrogate thing like how salvor was born? and who's this pater?
<br><br>
foundation's red against empire's blue.
<br><br>
and once again, how fucking INSANE must it be to live in the shadow of your prophet !!!!!!  but also he's just a fucking asshole mathematician!!! it's so wild to see the legacy/mythos of hari/salvor in one scene, and then actually get to see hari & salvor interact in the next. okay jaegger, cool it down a lil. "wither? jackass" SO true poly
<br><br>
"hober mallow"?? so. does the hari on terminus know what the hari with salvor & gaal knows? also "get hober mallow" feels a lil ambiguous. get him and then what?
<br><br>
also i hate to say it but hober mallow sounds like a hobbit name. a friendly chocolate-maker. someone like that.
<br><br>
gaal sees salvor dead. but again, HOW FIXED IS THE FUTURE i have questions !!!!!!!!!
<br><br><hr><br>
S02E03
<br><br>
okay so salvor & gaal both think the vision will happen, that salvor will die. and salvor raises a good point about plot armor&mdash;is it impossible for salvor to die before then?
<br><br>
once again, hari does whatever he wants and doesn't tell anyone. welcome to oona i guess!!
<br><br>
poly thinks the incineration of jaegger is a judgement. hari's judgement? "how could seldon's math foresee someone specific like hober mallow?" great question. also it occurs to me&mdash;do we have confirmation that hober mallow is a person? could it be a thing? lmao same thought, brother constant
<br><br>
"humans will wallow for a very long time." reminds me of what L was saying about the world of the last of us. if the world changes, and it's impossible or near impossible for it to go back to how it was before&mdash;what level of sacrifice is justified to try to bring the old world back? at what point do you say&mdash;this is how it is now, and we have to deal with it rather than trying to go back? even if it's "worse"? i guess this is different though, because the great universe changing downfall hasn't happened yet.
<br><br>
oh okay so poly knew hober.
<br><br>
it's kind of funny that hari is wearing like a very normal white button down shirt like is there a j crew on terminus. god he's so fucking annoying slap that boi back into the radiant if he's going to be so secretive all the time
<br><br>
!!! empire told bel they executed his husband and then dumped him in the salt flats!! as in season 1 they really know how to do punishment. although i have to say i'm feeling a lil suspicious of demerzel. there was really no better person for the job than the dude you took everything from?? she seems to have a soft spot for him maybe
<br><br>
"traditionally doors have hinges and maybe a knob" gaal i love u
<br><br>
"i don't know what's going to happen next" hari did that hurt you to say
<br><br>
a castler!! what a neat piece of tech. also that forcer has great eyeliner
<br><br>
bel riose seems so strong. thought his husband was dead, forced labor for six something years, still speaks as he does to empire. "just the two us" and day dismisses dawn and dusk. i feel like earlier day would have kept his brothers around since they're all the same. SO interesting that bel shows his loyalty like that.
<br><br>
OH MY GOD
<br><br>
says don't kiss me while i'm still 713!! get that man a shower and then get that man a kiss!!!
<br><br>
day and demerzel creeping in on bel & glawan!!! "do you know how lucky we are to have you" FUCKING RIGHT DAY DEMERZEL IS THE BEST AND YOU SHOULD KNOW IT. god the way she reassures him with her hands around his neck !!
<br><br>
"something is off, this whole planet is wrong" and from season one, salvor is good at seeing lies. who is in the cave!!
<br><br>
"you and him, you've got your own language. and i don't speak it." are gaal and hari the only two real psychohistorians? if no one else can understand the math?
<br><br>
hober mallow is very nonchalant about his imminent death. he's got another bracelet, right?? lmao called it
<br><br>
"for the sake of all these people, i don't have the luxury of settling the score" bel i love you already. moral responsibility over personal revenge !!
<br><br>
AWWW they're all saluting him. "welcome home" !! home!! also i'm so immediately intrigued by she-bends-light
<br><br>
wait why don't bel/glay/she-bends go to the creches? or maybe that happens after the scene cut
<br><br>
jeez, the beggar's been through a lot. is that mining equipment trying to kill them??
<br><br>
hari's alive again??? what IS this place?? TWO "i don't know"s from hari in one episode??
<br><br>
