  WE'RE BACK BABY
<br><br>
  i'm gonna be honest here i really do not remember much of the end of season one just because so so much happened and i didn't do media notes like this back then but hopefully that's not too big an issue
<br><br>
  oh thank fuck, a recap
<br><br>
  this has big "monologue on an empty stage" energy. is the. program that contains hari corrupted in some way? dude does not look like he is having a good time.
<br><br>
  salvor to gaal: "mom feels a little loaded" so true. just how far into the future did they sleep?
<br><br>
  day is fucking demerzel ??????? that's her right?? the mother figure who killed dawn ??? and then immediately using her as a shield ? what the FUCK SIR
<br><br>
  also god. she's really everything to him.
<br><br>
  flashbacks to hari as a child, playing with shadows. four dimensional object, three dimensional shape. we're all shadows, it's true. => and that's how you break out of the mirror triangle prison, by realizing there is an outside to break out to. who is this not-yanna ??
<br><br>
  shadows, math, creations, traps, seeing, knowing. the whole shadows thing feels like a plato's cave reference&mdash;up a level. if all you know and see is three dimensional, how do you conceptualize the idea that maybe your entire world is nothing more than the projection of a four dimensional thing? so if hari is able to make that conceptual leap, that's why he's able to figure out the prime radiant math/do his statistical predictions.
<br><br>
  and visually, the prime radiant just looks like some kind of hyper dimensional object, with the way all the vertices are connected like that. and yet he's trapped inside it, trapped inside his own creation. so making that conceptual leap wasn't enough&mdash;he's still trapped in some kind of cave?
<br><br>
  hari is bound to the prime radiant, to his own creation. his creation of psychohistory in season one elevated him to god-status, kind of, and yet now he's trapped. kind of a reoccurring theme with him. he knows (or thinks he knows) what's going to happen, and he can kind of do something about it, but he's also trapped by his plan. foundation definitely does play around with fate in interesting ways&mdash;is the universe doomed, or isn't it?
<br><br>
  reminds me of some of those philosophical arguments about the existence of god. is hari omniscient? arguably yes. omnipotent? definitely not. benevolent? well. hari would probably say he's doing everything for the benefit of humankind, and yet and yet.
<br><br>
  on trantor&mdash;god imagine living in the shadow of your prophet. like he's just !! right there !!
<br><br>
  two haris??? that's two too many
<br><br>
  okay okay so this is a new dawn, right? because demerzel killed the old one. but it's not the one the rebels grew, is it? or no never mind it's been too many years. did we ever find out what happened to that clone though?
<br><br>
  the assassin had no eyes?????? day's getting married?? he wants to have a kid?? is his earring changing sides?? so many questions
<br><br>
  oh i'd be so dead i can't hold my breath for shit. holy shit i feel like this plan should not have worked at all but i'm happy it did
<br><br>
  oh okay day is cleon xvii. aw dusk is still an artist
<br><br>
  so now not-kalle is the one pulling hari's strings? interesting interesting.
<br><br>
  the ghost in the machine is OUT and he's MAD
<br><br>
