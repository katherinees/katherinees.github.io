  EP 1
<br><br>
sudden shift between mysterious/ominous "who are you?" and the "hi take a survey? :)"
<br><br>
she's immediately suspicious, trying to escape. "let me out, open the door." immediate assumption she's in trouble, panic. "what do i get at the end of the survey?" interested in how things benefit her, knowledge gathering
<br><br>
"first question: who are you?" "that's the first question?" "first name will do." => she interprets as a philosophical question, he only means the identifier
<br><br>
work has the stronger incentive to keep its employees happy? well i guess of course, otherwise the employees would want free time, and the whole thing would collapse. it's the most unbalanced life ever. it also bears the question, if company can treat its employees so well in the work partition, why can't it just do that in the regular partition? so they must be doing something that is in someway objectionable to the people in the regular partition.
<br><br>
looong white wall hallways
<br><br>
does he even know what hungover is? did they kill petey??? tf was up with the handshake thing? god this would be as if someone told you your work bestie had died. it's all the same thing
<br><br>
by the book and happy about it. but in a way that makes him seem absolutely insane. and he's def gonna notice that cut on his forehead. oh jesus fuck to be within twenty feet of endless forbidden knowledge, and to have to not look.
<br><br>
oh god rat in a maze rat in a maze, they're never gonna let her go!!!! did they all go through that? when she keeps coming back, is it all on the same day for him? and her outside life just keeps sending her back to try again and again? that's the like waiting period to get a job? so an element of time travel too?
<br><br>
interesting mix of futuristic/retro tech. WAIT has less time passed in the work partition? that makes sense right? because all time is relative!!! no wait lol that doesn't make any sense right? the time has to be 1-to-1
<br><br>
oh god he's doing it to forget her. and he's shortening the time to process it. so every feeling just gets dragged out
<br><br>
you have to trust that the other half of you is doing equally or better than you to not go wild. requires some kind of optimism or else it's self harm.
<br><br>
WAIT mrs selvig is the ceo (?) lady??? does she know what's in which?
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 2
<br><br>
okay so milcock is in communication with the work partition on both sides right. why were they so excited that helly was joining?
<br><br>
god i cannot imagine never sleeping wtf wtf
<br><br>
also. lumon. unit of light, right?
<br><br>
the thing with the group photo. mark wants it out of sight, out of mind? does irving want to mourn petey a lil more? or is he just a stickler for rules?
<br><br>
quitting is like committing suicide oh my god. death is something that happens outside of here.
<br><br>
defensive and angry about having been severed. does he regret?
<br><br>
is irving not sleeping in the outside? it's not his fault if he can't ever sleep though right? what if his outside self is trying to get him fired, but doesn't know about the whole break room/punishment system? what was under his fingernails?
<br><br>
get a lil bit of sunlight and greenery in the wellness room. and nowhere else.
<br><br>
cleaning data. surveillance? warfare? like it's got to be some kind of atrocity right?
<br><br>
