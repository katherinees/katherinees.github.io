  EP 1
<br><br>
sudden shift between mysterious/ominous "who are you?" and the "hi take a survey? :)"
<br><br>
she's immediately suspicious, trying to escape. "let me out, open the door." immediate assumption she's in trouble, panic. "what do i get at the end of the survey?" interested in how things benefit her, knowledge gathering
<br><br>
"first question: who are you?" "that's the first question?" "first name will do." => she interprets as a philosophical question, he only means the identifier
<br><br>
work has the stronger incentive to keep its employees happy? well i guess of course, otherwise the employees would want free time, and the whole thing would collapse. it's the most unbalanced life ever. it also bears the question, if company can treat its employees so well in the work partition, why can't it just do that in the regular partition? so they must be doing something that is in someway objectionable to the people in the regular partition.
<br><br>
looong white wall hallways
<br><br>
does he even know what hungover is? did they kill petey??? tf was up with the handshake thing? god this would be as if someone told you your work bestie had died. it's all the same thing
<br><br>
by the book and happy about it. but in a way that makes him seem absolutely insane. and he's def gonna notice that cut on his forehead. oh jesus fuck to be within twenty feet of endless forbidden knowledge, and to have to not look.
<br><br>
oh god rat in a maze rat in a maze, they're never gonna let her go!!!! did they all go through that? when she keeps coming back, is it all on the same day for him? and her outside life just keeps sending her back to try again and again? that's the like waiting period to get a job? so an element of time travel too?
<br><br>
interesting mix of futuristic/retro tech. WAIT has less time passed in the work partition? that makes sense right? because all time is relative!!! no wait lol that doesn't make any sense right? the time has to be 1-to-1
<br><br>
oh god he's doing it to forget her. and he's shortening the time to process it. so every feeling just gets dragged out
<br><br>
you have to trust that the other half of you is doing equally or better than you to not go wild. requires some kind of optimism or else it's self harm.
<br><br>
WAIT mrs selvig is the ceo (?) lady??? does she know what's in which?
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 2
<br><br>
okay so milcock is in communication with the work partition on both sides right. why were they so excited that helly was joining?
<br><br>
god i cannot imagine never sleeping wtf wtf
<br><br>
also. lumon. unit of light, right? ah no lumen is the unit of luminous flux.
<br><br>
the thing with the group photo. mark wants it out of sight, out of mind? does irving want to mourn petey a lil more? or is he just a stickler for rules?
<br><br>
quitting is like committing suicide oh my god. death is something that happens outside of here.
<br><br>
defensive and angry about having been severed. does he regret?
<br><br>
is irving not sleeping in the outside? it's not his fault if he can't ever sleep though right? what if his outside self is trying to get him fired, but doesn't know about the whole break room/punishment system? what was under his fingernails?
<br><br>
get a lil bit of sunlight and greenery in the wellness room. and nowhere else.
<br><br>
cleaning data. surveillance? warfare? like it's got to be some kind of atrocity right?
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 3
<br><br>
it's temporary he says, as if he knows
<br><br>
okay so by mrs selvig's house interior, i don't think she has any idea what she does at lumen right. so. her at lumen is her without the grief of her husband passing, just as mark at lumen is without the grief of his wife passing. who are we without our grief?
<br><br>
"you carry the hurt down there with you. you just don't know what it is" and they're all tortured by grief they cannot possibly resolve, because they don't have the memories or context for it
<br><br>
mrs selvig so sneaky. okay nvm she probably does know.
<br><br>
also yes how do any of them know what art movements are?
<br><br>
"what i just did was to help you." "open or closed?" "both"
<br><br>
im telling you, morse code!! stain the underside of your fingernails like irving did! show up to work having not slept at all! don't eat breakfast, get a raisin stuck in your teeth! takes a while, but it's not letters!
<br><br>
optics and design&mdash;if they have to look at art, do they get to engage with deeper meanings?
<br><br>
who/what/where is the board? MDR?
<br><br>
"remembered man does not decay" yikes. woe frolic dread malice okay mr four humors sir. calls them his children, set up as a god figure. a replica of his house like a temple
<br><br>
why is irving so into it. without history, we are shapeless. so irving pours himself into the lumen mold. just the smiles, no eyes.
<br><br>
why is mark important? (is mark important?) like harmony/selvig spends all this time interacting with him, but acts like she hates him at work. what's the point?
<br><br><hr><br>
EP 4
<br><br>
why is dylan so incredibly suspicious of o & d
<br><br>
oh mdr = macrodata refinement. interestingly, also, mdr = mort de rire
<br><br>
the only art and beauty irving gets to see is from o&d !! and he yearns for it as he yearns for love !!
<br><br>
"I AM A PERSON. YOU ARE NOT"
<br><br>
chinese finger traps&mdash;the more you struggle, the worse it gets
<br><br>
who serves wine at a funeral?? is that a thing??
<br><br>
this is an astonishingly appropriate home video for a funeral
<br><br>
"I need you to run a special wellness session for Mark S" "what's the problem?" => wellness sessions are responses to problems. a perversion of wellness
<br><br>
okay so that painting burt is hanging up, that figure looks like a flipped wanderer above the sea of fog by caspar david friedrich right? that feels thematic. are the other paintings also references?
<br><br>
an acrostic poem&mdash;typically the work of schoolchildren. but for these people, who have no interaction with art/culture, ricken's book which to us would seem cringe, is like a miracle
