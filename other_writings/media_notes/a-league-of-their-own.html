  EP 1
<br><br>
  1943
<br><br>
  she's so full of things to say and she wants to say them, even to this old lady who was just making conversation on the train
<br><br>
  so she's like "i like that elizabeth didn't have butterflies when they first met. and then later they had a great love story" and she looks at a photo of a man. waiting on the great love story? trying to convince herself that she'll have one?
<br><br>
  "dream when you're feeling blue" and carson's wearing blue :)
<br><br>
  YES GOD THE FEELING OF BEING SURROUNDED BY PPL WHO LOVE WHAT YOU LOVE AND WHO LOOK LIKE YOU IM EMOTIONAL
<br><br>
  i love their relationship & how clance is immediately like okay so we're both going to california then
<br><br>
  WE'RE ALL FUCKING FRUIT
<br><br>
  greek chorus hair salon customers :)
<br><br>
  we love an old, old friendship :)
<br><br>
  !!!!! greta im sorry but wtf. that's a woman who loves secrets, and i love that for her
<br><br><hr><br>
  EP 2
<br><br>
  tbh wasn't expecting the coach to be nice to them but love to see it
<br><br>
  "it's the price of admission" :(
<br><br>
  oh nvm :(
<br><br>
  god the refusal to let yourself want anything because everything you want is against what society says you should want!! because it never goes right!!
<br><br>
  max !!!
<br><br><hr><br>
  EP 3
<br><br>
  "how many sinking boats have you been on? tell me about each one." je t'aime
<br><br>
  sneaking out at night to do the thing you wanna do :)
<br><br>
  where's that quote that's like "to be a lesbian in a heteronormative world is to be almost by definition gender non conforming"
<br><br>
  "it was all of us. i mean it was me physically, my body, but it was the support system i had." :)
<br><br>
  and if your mom's dreams aren't your dreams, too fucking bad, because it's your mom, and you owe her :(
<br><br><hr><br>
  EP 4
<br><br>
  carson u genius :)
<br><br>
  something something historically convents as safe spaces for queer women
<br><br>
  greta already sees them ending, carson doesn't really
<br><br>
  "they play dirty, we're gonna play fucking filthy" :)))
<br><br>
  aunt bertie?
<br><br>
  foil in the double date
<br><br>
  :((((
<br><br>
  guy meets clance where she is, and vice versa.
<br><br>
  "absence makes the heart grow stronger" "it's fonder" "that too" => greta tries to be strong, but carson wants to be in love
<br><br>
  narratively i don't get why carson is so opposed to lupe going back in. she advocated for her to a rest in the first place, but now she doesn't want her? she associates her with dove? what happened to the game comes first? and this has always been, they excluded her from early practices too. hm. it's because lupe is playing the man's game, maybe? she wants dove's approval, she looks down on esti? maybe also an element of&mdash;greta trusts me to be the coach, so i want to do it and be that for her, versus lupe volunteers herself.
<br><br>
  upset that max wasn't able to pitch well at the company team practice. but think this fits with the theme of "we only do well when we all play together". she throws that insane ball in ep 1 with clance at her side. but without the support of her parents, she can't throw. now that she's fighting with clance, she's resorting to blackmail (?). mirrors the peaches&mdash;they do super well when the team is in sync with each other. immediately fall apart when there's infighting.
<br><br><hr><br>
  EP 5
<br><br>
  this is fine with the house on fire
<br><br>
  "you love me but you don't like me" :(((( and once you know it you can't unknow it
<br><br>
  carson: hm have to talk to a person and i'm nervous about it. ah, i'll bake a pie !! :)
<br><br>
  :( max saw bertie and was like i do Not want this, and now she's pendulum swinging in the other direction. ah the horrors of straight sex :(
<br><br>
  baseball is so tied up in max's identity/queerness
<br><br>
  WHEN WE PLAY TOGETHER WE DO BETTER YEAH BB
<br><br><hr><br>
