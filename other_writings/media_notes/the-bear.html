  carmen went to fancy school.
<br><br>
  becoming our parents, becoming our fathers. cycles and inescapability of home.
<br><br>
  "I can fix this place." "no one's asking you to"
<br><br>
  pourquoi bear? sugar?

  so why did michael kill himself? why didn't he want carmy working there?
<br><br>
  why does richie want to do everything for himself
<br><br>
  "I got the wrong caulk." "I didn't." I love u sydney
<br><br>
  oh so he was sleepwalking
<br><br>
  putting things back. like he was never there. inability to change.

  Richie just has so Much. much muchness. every single thing he feels he shares. anger joy everything. it doesn't matter with who. yell at carmy one moment, try to show him a funny video the next.
<br><br>
  lmao why does everyone hate pete. oh I get it.
<br><br>
  oh my FUCK are there drugs in the punch.
<br><br>
  so cicero knew carmy's dad ?
<br><br>
  cicero's dream => dad dies because cicero is trying to avoid some kid. symbolically right is the kid carmy?
<br><br>
  tina expecting that sydney would never ever approve of her, so she was being defensive to avoid it.
<br><br>

<br><br>
we still don't know why michael never let him work with him?
<br><br>
i think one thing i really love in this show it that it knows what it means to be slow. and to have silences and pauses. it's all so choreographed and i love it
<br><br>
sydney & marcus's relationship is too cute omg
<br><br>
michael says: keep it simple, stupid

marcus's devotion <&#47;3 . gentle hands to hold the elderly person's hands, strong hands to scrape the ice off his car
<br><br>

<br><br>
the boy can't add he's just like me for real
<br><br>
"yo do you ever think about purpose" "i love you but i do not have time for this..... i have time for this. purpose?" l m a o
<br><br>
i wonder if riche's book is real. aww richie <&#47;3 interesting to see this asshole clearly and intentionally trying to work on himself
<br><br>
