	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>I'm Katherine, and sometimes I'm an artist but mostly I'm a college engineering student at Northwestern University majoring in applied mathematics with a minor in computer science. I'm endlessly fascinated by the ways that math, CS, and art interact and look for ways to combine them in my work. </p>
	<p>Talk to me about webcomics, sci fi, modern art, math, and weird food. Send me your album and song recommendations. Right now I'm reading <i>The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turning's Historical Paper on Computability and the Turning Machine</i> by Charles Petzold and listening to <i>Love Death Immortality</i> by the Glitch Mob, <i>Saturation III</i> by Brockhampton, and <i>About Time</i> by Sabrina Claudio.</p>
