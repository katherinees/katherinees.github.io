	<h2>Waking<div style="color:gray">2017</div></h2>
	<p>Not really glitch art, but an ongoing series involving fractal curves and nature photography. </p>
	<p>One of my favorite fractal curves is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve" target="_blank">Hilbert curve</a>, which is an iteratively drawn space	filling curve and an excellent doodle game. When overlaid on a grid, the curve passes through each square exactly once. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_curve" target="_blank">Moore curve</a> is a variation on this curve, obtained by placing four copies of an iteration of the Hilbert curve so that their endpoints coincide. When making pieces in this series, I take a photograph, mask it with a Moore curve, and overlay it on a flipped copy of itself.</p><br>

	<h2>This Is A Tiling Composed Of Twenty-Two Colored Six-Sided Polygons <div style="color:gray">2016</div></h2>
	<p>Computer screens use RGB color space to display colors as some combination of red, green, and blue; in base 10 (decimal) the amount of each color ranges from 0 to 255, and in base 16 (hexadecimal) this same range is expressed as 0 to FF. You can reference a particular color by its hexadecimal code - #000000 is pure black, #FFFFFF is pure white, #FF0000 is red, #00FF00 is green, #0000FF is blue.</p>
	<p>ASCII is a character encoding standard used in computers that assigns characters to numbers between 0 and 127 (when in decimal). You can look up charts that give the ASCII code for every letter of the alphabet from capital A (65) to lowercase z (112), as well as for other characters like a question mark (63) or even a space (32).</p>
	<p>Combining these two concepts means that you can express a combination of three characters as a color (or vice versa). Thus the word 'Art' can be expressed as the three decimal numbers 65, 114, 116, which in hexadecimal are 41, 72, 74, and describe a color #417274, kind of a muted, darker blue-green.</p>
	<p>In this way, the colors of the hexagons came from the title phrase, thus encoding a description of an image into the image itself.</p>

	<h2>Dance shoes <div style="color:gray">2012</div></h2>
	<p>Contour line in pen</p>
	<p>Continuous contour line is a style of drawing in which the artist sketches the outline of the subject while using, as much as possible, one continuous line. This is not a style that is conducive to getting perspective right or drawing straight lines. In a way, it's kind of freeing - you have one shot at it, one line, no erasing.</p>
	<p>Do ballet, plus a little modern and jazz, for almost fourteen years and you pick up a lot of shoes. </p>
	<p>I always liked doing art, but when I switched high schools going into tenth grade, I decided to try taking studio art as one of my core classes. I'm so glad I did, the art program was fantastic. At college, I don't have room in my schedule for art classes anymore, but I try to continue to make art. This was my very first homework assignment as a sophomore in Studio Art I.</p>

	<h2>Cryptomouth <div style="color:gray">2017</div></h2>
	<p>While making this, I was thinking about love letters, codes, public key encryption, key signing, and the phrase 'sealed with a kiss'. The background text is encrypted with a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.</p>
	<p>Choose a keyphrase, delete all spaces and repeating letters. So for example, the key "Katherine Does Art Sometimes" becomes "katherindosm." To create the cipher aphabet, have the first letter of the keyphrase match to A, the second to B, and so on. Once you've finished with all the letters in the keyphrase, continue with the rest of the alphabet, starting with the next letter after the last letter of the key, and then wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet. We don't want any letter to be coded to itself, so we shift the enciphered alphabet (if necessary) until there are no such repetitions.</p>
	<p>This monoalphabetic substitution cipher, an improvement on the Caesar cipher, was in use throughout the first millennium CE, but was eventually broken by Arabic cryptanalysists using frequency analysis at least as early as the ninth century. I wrote Matlab functions for encryption and decryption using the cipher (and when I have any free time ever I'll make better python versions and put it in my github because right now the Matlab versions are annoyingly inelegant).</p>

	<h2>Detail from Raven Structure <div style="color:gray">2014</div></h2>
	<p>A section of a visualization of the poem The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe, made using Gephi.</p>
	<p>Part of my junior year high school art independent project. I used an open source data visualization program to look at the structure of the first few stanzas one of my favorite poems. Each unique word became a node in the graph, with the size of the node proportional to the frequency of the word in the poem. Edges connect consecutive words, with heavier lines showing where two words appear next to each other multiple times.</p>
