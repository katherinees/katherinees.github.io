  <h2>Floor It</h2>
  <p><i>Baby Driver</i>, 2017 Edgar Wright film. <i>Ocean's 8</i>, 2018 Gary Ross film, travel posters by Alex Asfour, short animated films <i>Electrocop</i> by Corentin Yvergniaux and <i>Voltige</i> by L&eacute;o Brunel.</p><hr><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XMuUVw7TOM">first scene</a> of <i>Baby Driver</i> has to be one of the best first scenes of all time. Within the first few minutes we get to see Baby, a music loving getaway driver, do his thing&mdash;i.e., drive a pretty car super fast and perfectly in time to the song he's playing on his iPod. While a bank robbery goes on in the background, Baby is rocking out in the car, and once they need to make their escape, he leads the police on a merry chase around downtown Atlanta, all to the beat of Bellbottoms by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.</p><p>At its heart, <i>Baby Driver</i> is a classic action movie with a hint of romance, and while it does at times flirt with the cliche, it has so much <i>fun</i> with it that it's still one of my favorite movies. Every scene, every moment, every shot seems like it was carefully crafted for effect, and put together, it's amazing to watch. No wonder it was nominated for and won various awards for editing and sound mixing&mdash;it's a masterpiece, full stop.</p><hr><p>For another flashy action movie, try Gary Ross's 2018 <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5164214/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Ocean's 8</a></i>. I adore heist movies like this, I like seeing all the planning and then watch each little piece fall into place. Points for an all-women heist team featuring Sandra Bullock, Rihanna, and Awkwafina, double points for the scene where they all show up at the Met Gala looking <i>flawless</i>.</p><p>If you too dream of driving off into the sunset with vintage flair, check out the work of Alex Asfour, and his travel posters in particular. His freelance work is at <a href="http://www.ideastormstudios.com">IdeaStorm Creative Studio</a>, but I think it's easier to check out all the amazing travel posters through his online <a href="http://ideastorm.bigcartel.com">store</a>. The collection has a cohesive feel, but each poster is unique, and the colors and gradients are just absolutely gorgeous!&nbsp;</p><p>I studied abroad in Arles, France a few summers ago, and one of the highlights was watching the end-of-year projects from the nearby animation school Ecole MoPA in a Roman amphitheater. These students are seriously talented (one recent graduation project was nominated for an Oscar) and a lot of their work is posted online. If you loved the music synched car scenes of <i>Baby Driver</i>, watch <i><a href="https://vimeo.com/167422015">Electrocop</a></i> by Corentin Yvergniaux. (I think the theme of the year was cars&mdash;another of my favorites was <i><a href="https://vimeo.com/167532594">Voltige</a></i> by L&eacute;o Brunel.)</p>
