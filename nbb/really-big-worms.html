  <h2>Really Big Worms</h2>
  <p><i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert, science fiction novel. <i>Ender's Game</i> by Orson Scott Card, <i>Too Like the Lightning</i> by Ada Palmer, and <i>Drive</i> by Dave Kellett.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Intrigue! Revolution! Ecology and religion and <i>really</i> big worms! <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538859852&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=dune&amp;dpID=41dYX%252BWUkaL&amp;preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch">Dune</a></i> has it all. This is one of <i>the</i> classic science fiction novels&mdash;an excellent choice both for those who don't read a lot of sci fi and want to start with a Hugo and Nebula winner (I will pretty much read anything with a Hugo nomination, and I haven't been let down yet) as well as for those who are already sci fi lovers.</p><p><i>Dune</i> drops you straight into the middle of the story, and it's up to you to figure out this strange future world as it goes along. Case in point: the book begins as the Duke of House Atreides, his concubine the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, their son Paul, and their advisors and servants are headed to Arrakis, a harsh desert planet which is the only source of the invaluable spice <i>melange</i>. Right away the reader is left with a thousand questions and no choice but to keep reading in hopes of getting some answers&mdash;the kind of world building which is absolutely my <i>jam </i>(although you might want to give it a couple of chapters to really get going). This is a novel with some major scope, and just from a literary standpoint, a worthwhile read. <i>Dune</i> was published in 1965, and since then has become the best selling science fiction novel of all time and has had a huge cultural impact (there's even a crater on the moon named for the book).</p><hr><p>Frank Herbert also wrote five sequels to <i>Dune</i>, there's a 1984 film, a miniseries, and even more books written by others inspired by <i>Dune</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you loved the whole Chosen One vibe of Paul, but wanted something set in a slightly more familiar setting, try <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enders-Ender-Quintet-Orson-Scott/dp/0812550706/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538859887&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=ender%27s+game&amp;dpID=51L10EnuJbL&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch">Ender's Game</a></i> by Orson Scott Card. It's got that young protagonist trying to deal with his duties/destiny, but most of it is set on, or in orbit around, Earth. It also won the Hugo and Nebula awards and also has many sequels.&nbsp;</p><p>If you loved the intense figure-it-out-as-you-go-along world building, but wanted something a little more modern, try <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Too-Like-Lightning-Terra-Ignota/dp/0765378019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538859925&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=too+like+the+lightning+ada+palmer">Too Like the Lightning</a></i> by Ada Palmer, the first in her Terra Ignota series. If Dune is the Baby Boomer's or Gen X's science fiction, <i>Too Like the Lightning</i> belongs to the millennials and Gen Z. An excellent mix of political intrigue, discussions of gender dynamics, philosophy, and murder.</p><p>If you loved the idea of the secretive transportation Guild and a government spanning solar systems, but were looking for something funny and a bit less intense, try <i><a href="http://www.drivecomic.com">Drive</a></i>, an ongoing webcomic by Dave Kellett. I like the art style all in blue and white, the characters are lovable, and Dave Kellett is a master of comedic timing in comic panels.</p>
