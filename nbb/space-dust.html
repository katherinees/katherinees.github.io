  <h2>Space Dust</h2>

	<p><i>Space Sweepers</i>, 2021 Jo Sung-hee film. <i>Typeset in the Future</i> book and essays by Dave Addey; <i>The Mandalorian</i> tv show; Scott Listfield art.</p>

	<p>If you're looking for a fun sci-fi action movie, give <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12838766/?ref_=tt_urv">Space Sweepers</a></i>, on Netflix, a try. This Korean movie follows the crew of the <i>Victory</i>, a junk collector ship, as they try and make some money gathering tons of the space trash in orbit around a dying Earth. Meanwhile, the CEO of a company building bubble ecosystems&mdash;paradise in space, for only the very wealthy, of course&mdash;plans to expansions to Mars. A news broadcast warns the public of a bomb called "Dorothy" that looks like a young child.</p>

	<p>I think the Netflix trailer makes it seem like a more serious and dramatic movie than it is, so maybe don't watch it first and just go into <i>Space Sweepers</i> with an open mind. Really it's a wonderful way to spend a Friday night, with some takeout on the sofa. If you like sassy androids, found family stories, and beautiful CGI, this one's for you.</p>

	<p>Small, adorable being, possibly dangerous, hunted for money, is found by badass fighters with sad backstories, who immediately go "baby!" and adopt it as their own. This is a description for both <i>Space Sweepers</i> and <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8111088/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt">The Mandalorian</a></i>, streaming on Disney+. If you like space operas, you may like this <i>Star Wars</i> spinoff show about a stoic bounty hunter who finds a tiny child and, somewhat against his better judgement, decides to keep it. (If you've never seen <i>Star Wars</i>, no worries, you don't really have to know anything about the films to keep up with this tv series.)</p>

	<p>One of my favorite tropes in sci-fi is when a character speaks in one language, and another responds in a different one, and they both understand each other because they have fancy translator headsets or whatever. In <i>Space Sweepers</i>, characters speak Korean, Arabic, Spanish, French, English at each other, and it all just flows&mdash;implying a multicultural setting where nearly anyone can speak and be understood. Another way language can be used in sci-fi worldbuilding is through text design&mdash;in <i><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com">Typeset in the Future</a></i>, a series of essays also adapted into a <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/typeset-in-the-future-typography-and-design-in-science-fiction-movies/9781419727146">book</a>, Dave Addey explores how using the right typography in movies helps create the setting (short-cut tip, if you want your title cards to look futuristic, just write them in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile">Eurostile</a>).</p>

	<p>In <i>Space Sweepers</i>, we don't get to see much of Earth, which is undergoing a climate crisis and becoming unfit for habitation. But if we had, maybe it would have looked something like the beautiful artwork of <a href="https://www.astronautdinosaur.com">Scott Listfield</a>, who paints astronauts exploring the ruins of today's world&mdash;a broken McDonald's sign half buried in sand, a rusted and tireless car abandoned in the desert, statues covered in graffiti.</p>
