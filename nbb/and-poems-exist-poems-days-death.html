  <h2>and poems exist; poems, days, death</h2>

	<p><i>The Only Harmless Great Thing</i> by Brooke Bolander. <i>Alphabet</i> by Inger Christensen, translated by Susanna Nied; <i>The Windup Girl</i> by Paolo Bacigalupi; art by Evan M Cohen.</p>

	<hr>

	<p>How do you leave a message for the future, when the future is almost unimaginably far away? How do you craft a warning that can last for 10,000 years? How do you tell a people who may remember nothing of today's world&mdash;from its languages to its writing systems to maybe even the fact that we ever existed at all&mdash;that this place is not safe, that there is something dangerous here? These are the questions at the heart of nuclear semiotics&mdash;how to communicate long term nuclear waste warnings. In <i><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/only-harmless-great-thing/9781250169488">The Only Harmless Great Thing</a></i> by Brooke Bolander, a story about memory and radium girls, scientists propose a possible answer: elephants.</p>

	<p>Tying together a cast of characters, each with their own unique voice, I love the way this novella builds a story of scale. One girl, mostly powerless against a system that was only ever built to use her up, never protect her; one scientist, trying to build a movement that can last millennia; a heartbreaking last stand, raging against injustice.</p>

	<p>If you enjoyed the whimsical writing of <i>The Only Harmless Great Thing</i>, try <i><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/alphabet-9780811214773/9780811214773">Alphabet</a></i> by Inger Christensen, a poem about the beauty of the world and the horror of the things that can destroy it. Following a rigid structure, each section focuses on a letter of the alphabet and contains a number of lines following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a>. Gorgeously translated into English by Susanna Nied, it begins simply, delicately, like this: "apricot trees exist, apricot trees exist" and then "bracken exists; and blackberries, blackberries;/bromine exists; and hydrogen, hydrogen".</p>

	<p>Capitalism will kill you if it can. In <i>The Only Harmless Great Thing</i>, and also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls">in real life</a> in the 1920s, factory workers drew numbers on clocks with radium paint, with terrible consequences to their health. Among other things, <i><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-windup-girl/9781597808217">The Windup Girl</a></i> by Paolo Bacigalupi is also a story of worker exploitation, but this time set in futuristic Thailand, when most of the world's agricultural industry is held hostage by calorie companies, who sell sterile, genetically modified seeds.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/evanmcohen/">Evan M Cohen</a> is one of my favorite artists right now&mdash;I adore the way he uses simple and beautiful prose, halftone dot texture, limited color palettes, and careful composition to create sequential art. In particular check out his <a href="http://www.evanmcohen.com/life">Life</a> series; as one panel morphs into the next, figures dissolve into water, hands become flowers, a sun rises and sets and transforms into a bird. "<a href="http://www.evanmcohen.com/life/0dyt0sd6ps3c2ojsks61so5hx6f283">When is the next time I will see you?</a>" asks one work. "<a href="http://www.evanmcohen.com/life/t24921h80awz0tc1z65w41utlw3hza">I can't wait to finally see you again</a>," says another.</p>
