  <h2>Let's dance, off the beat</h2>

	<p><i>Go Farther In Lightness</i> by Gang of Youths. <i>On a Sunbeam</i> by Tillie Walden; <i>The Less Than Epic Adventures of TJ &amp; Amal</i> by E. K. Weaver; <i>Strange Desire</i> by the Bleachers.</p>

	<hr>

	<p>The latest album I've been listening to on repeat is <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0leVOEw8L2TnAfLGwkFnab?si=ifeFEBG4S_mwTCTaAny_Qw">Go Farther In Lightness</a></i> by Australian indie rock band Gang of Youths. It's a wild, wonderful album whose songs range from rock anthems to orchestral interludes, and from grief and loss to love and hope. I've watched a couple of their concerts on YouTube and they're excellent live&mdash;check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxuzT-in_TE">clip</a> from a performance of "Let Me Down Easy" to watch singer and main songwriter Dave Le'aupepe moving and grooving and dancing across a stage.</p>

	<p>It's an excellent album beginning to end, worth listening to all in order. But if I had to pick just one for someone to start out with, I'd say "Keep Me In the Open" is the archetype of a Gang of Youths song&mdash;beautiful lyrics touching on struggles with faith and relationships before ending with a repeating line: "I deserve better than this."</p>

	<p>If your favorite song off this album was the title track "Go Farther In Lightness," you might like Tillie Walden's sci-fi <i><a href="https://www.onasunbeam.com">On a Sunbeam</a></i>. The song, with its poetic lyrics and slow piano, and the graphic novel, with delicate line work and a limited color palette, both create a bittersweet mood of searching for peace while feeling a little bit lost. <i>On a Sunbeam</i> follows a young woman named Mia&mdash;chapters alternate between her present, living on a spaceship and working construction restoring crumbling architecture, and her past, falling in love as a student at a small private school.</p>

	<p>If you love the story of Achilles and Patroclus, your favorite song off this album was probably "Achilles Come Down." You might also like <i><a href="http://tjandamal.com/index.html">The Less Than Epic Adventures of TJ &amp; Amal</a></i> by E. K. Weaver, a webcomic which begins as Amal's seemingly perfect life implodes and he ends up going on a cross-country road trip. Particularly at the beginning, it's got that same self-destructive energy as "Achilles Come Down" but it ends in a beautiful place of healing and possibility.</p>

	<p>I also recommend <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0cnNCK2xpudXjB8pzsrYy9?si=kZm0ejkKTTKTS9UVnSxwuQ">Strange Desire</a></i> by the Bleachers, and not just because both it and <i>Go Farther In Lightness</i> have album covers featuring a black and white photo of a person sitting on a bed against a white wall. If your favorite song, like me, from the Gang of Youths album was "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5OpvDdVtYU">The Heart Is a Muscle</a>," try "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5osPtE7kXI">I Wanna Get Better</a>" from <i>Strange Desire</i>. Both have this straightforwardly optimistic energy, of being at a low point but still determinedly looking up&mdash;"It won't hurt this way forever, it ain't worth the overtime," promises Dave Le'aupepe; "I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars hey, I wanna get better!" sings Jack Antonoff.</p>
