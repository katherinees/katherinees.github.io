	<p>October marks one year of Never Be Bored! In celebration, here's twelve more things for the twelve posts of this year to add to your queue.</p>

	<p><a href="nbb/really-big-worms.html">Really Big Worms</a> is where it all began, with three sci fi novels and a webcomic. As I wrote in that post, I'll read just about anything with a Hugo nomination, and a year later, I've still never been let down. So don't just take my word for it, the volumes of <i><a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/saga">Saga</a></i> by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples have been nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story <i>six</i> times. If that's not a strong enough reason to check out this epic space opera masterpiece, I don't know what is.</p>

	<p>I kind of love those larger than life bad guys from <i>Baby Driver</i>, featured in <a href="nbb/floor-it.html">Floor It</a>. For more characters with a strong dedication to the Aesthetic and also to guns, try <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4139588/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4">Polar</a></i>, streaming on Netflix. Mads Mikkelsen is fabulous as an assassin who just wants to retire in peace, goddammit.</p>

	<p>In <a href="nbb/on-computability.html">On Computability</a> I recommended a book on a math paper by Alan Turing, but he's probably more well-known for his work helping to break codes during WWII and developing the field of artificial intelligence. Although it's not strictly historically accurate, <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1">The Imitation Game</a></i> is still a really lovely film about Turing's life, the kind of movie that reminds you why we make movies. And don't worry, there's far less math than there is in <i>The Annotated Turing</i>.</p>

	<p>If you liked the impeccably dressed murderesses of <a href="nbb/non-je-ne-regrette-rien.html">Non je ne regrette rien</a>, then you might like the fashionably attired gentlemen spies of <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802144/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a></i>. It's a funny action movie, with a lot of characters in really well tailored suits, what more can I say.</p>

	<p>I feel like Elio from <i>Call Me By Your Name</i>, featured in <a href="nbb/is-it-better-to-speak-or-die.html">Is it better to speak or die?</a>, might like <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1LDSPYtniVN09zmRdd1meQ?si=_NwqHoWGQ-S460wbDiPAmQ">The Hanging Gardens of Beatenberg</a></i> by Beatenberg. Something about the song "The Prince Of The Hanging Gardens" in particular reminds me of Elio and Oliver's relationship, but I adore that whole album, some of the lyrics are absolute poetry.</p>

	<p>In <a href="nbb/the-r-smith-edition.html">The R Smith Edition</a> I recommend a queer sci fi webcomic with gorgeous single color art. If you're into that, definitely try <i><a href="http://ohumanstar.com">O Human Star</a></i> by Blue Delliquanti. It's got amazing world building and so much diversity, and it has robots which is always a plus.</p>

	<p>If your favorite parts of <i>Worm</i>, featured in <a href="nbb/all-superheroes-need-therapy.html">All Superheroes Need Therapy</a>, were the chapters where some of these characters actually <i>got</i> therapy, you might like the TV show <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1">Lucifer</a></i>, about the literal devil taking a vacation in LA to solve crimes, and also getting therapy. Currently on Netflix.</p>

	<p>As the story of <i>Mr. Nobody</i> unfolds, we jump between alternate timelines; the three movies and book of <a href="nbb/nonlinearity.html">Nonlinearity</a> can get unsettling at times in the way they play with time and memory. If you liked those recommendations, try <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LROUW2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">1Q84</a></i> by Haruki Murakami, a dystopian mystery love story whose main character Aomame one day realizes she's slipped into a parallel world.</p>

	<p><i>Altered Carbon</i>, featured in <a href="nbb/to-whom-am-i-speaking.html">To Whom Am I Speaking?</a>, is a slightly cheesy sci fi show with probably more swearing and nudity than is necessary, but whatever, I love the concept of it. <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489974/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1">Carnival Row</a></i>, streaming on Amazon Prime,<i> </i>is basically the same, but fantasy&mdash;just one extended metaphor for racism but with magical creatures. It might not win any Emmys any time soon, but it's entertaining and fun to binge.</p>

	<p>If you liked reading Helicon, featured in <a href="nbb/the-northwestern-edition.html">The Northwestern Edition</a>, then you might enjoy going to <a href="http://cabf.no-coast.org">Chicago Art Book Fair</a>, this incredible three day event that brings independent artists and printers from all over to the Windy City. This November will be its third year, and I can't wait to go again!</p>

	<p>In <i>Art Curious</i>, featured in <a href="nbb/the-eye-of-the-beholder.html">The Eye of the Beholder</a>, we learn about art that was considered scandalous in the time and place of their creation, in ways we may not easily realize now. Shakespeare can have a reputation today of being super sophisticated, but back in the sixteenth century his plays were pop culture. Baz Luhrmann's <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117509/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1">Romeo + Juliet</a></i> reimagines the classic play in Verona Beach and does a wonderful job staying true to the original while being totally over the top and camp.</p>

	<p>In <a href="nbb/next.html">Next!</a>, I described the plays of the Neo-futurists of Chicago as sometimes serious, sometimes funny, maybe musical, fourth-wall-breaking. I could apply the same description to <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a></i>, one of my favorite movies of all time. I think Ferris would make a great neo-futurist.</p>
